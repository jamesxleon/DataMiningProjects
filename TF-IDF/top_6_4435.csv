11507,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291502,national treasure is about as overrated and overhyped as they come nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero and this film is no indiana jones people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rockerbr br i cant really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for maybe the preteen audience will like it but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous i also cant imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film simply put its just ok at bestbr br national treasure is unimagined and uninspired borrowing what it does have from the da vinci code i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 and passing on this nonsensebr br the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it while never damaging it once while fighting the bad guys and experiencing what is supposed to be nonstop action is absurd i particularly loved the scene with the declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it oh brother br br reminded me of that episode of the brady bunch where they go to the amusement park and mr brady loses his architectural plans except that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film br br the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish literally there are thousand of undiscovered priceless items in this treasure trove yeah right ridiculous br br even worse the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be tough clues to these ancient riddles are preposterous oh the humanity br br the performances by cage voight and the other actors in national treasure are as stiff wooden and flat as they come however when youre working with such lousy dialogue its hard to fault the actors 100 for thatbr br national treasure is an ok film to see once i cant recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top outlandish scavenger hunt of a messbr br rent it if you must see it first
4013,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441,facts about national lampoon goes to the movies aka national lampoons movie madnessbr br 1 the movie is poor even by lampoons typical standards 2 its not funny 3 no one goes to see a moviebr br so after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth its called national lampoon goes to the movies and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers an american guy goes to the movies how lame he isnt american and he doesnt go to movies none of the characters in lampoons socalled satire are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000 but it isntbr br this was national lampoons first film after animal house although you couldnt tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89minute movie that seems double the lengthbr br ive noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles  probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 198283 hmm movie madness  ive never heard of this movie before lets rent it and then the realization hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the moviesbr br it was shelved by mgmua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place youll manage to find itbr br its split up into three stories  a parody of selfenlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutalitycopbuddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff im not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped upbr br part ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter dont ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie only i can make love with my son if you think that doesnt sound very funny youre right  its not and just imagine  its the highlight of this filmbr br part iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but its extremely overacted  only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where hes choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or twobr br its a shame to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that theyre being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes  the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t  a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones its easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camerabr br the movie isnt funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracksbr br i like national lampoons vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fastbr br sad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their stamp of approval its like condemning a film before it even hits theaters  maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placeÂ…br br distributor this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval thatll teach you not to make something so awful next timebr br forget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a monthbr br its so bad that i cant even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up
11911,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395512,i just viewed this movie last night and i dont think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mindbr br the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson i will think of tinseltown which is a very bad thingbr br i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman i thought that it at least wouldnt be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrongbr br this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutesbr br the characters are paperthin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they dont even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to gilligans islandbr br the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national lampoons favorite deadly sins the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who cant find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this moviebr br the actors try kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i dont think it was the actors fault because they have bad materialbr br go watch the national lampoons movie but stay away from this movie
6526,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052564,though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of bloodbr br there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and scriptwritingbr br jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances ive ever seen  his descent into the maelstrm of madness is achingly selfaware and clumsy oh look at him twitch oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle oh look at his unwashed greasy dark hair oh listen to his affectedly husky voice he must be a tortured artistwritergenius oh yes out comes the poetshirt  its another boy who thinks hes byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a manual on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the defunct little plastic toyprize in a discontinued brand of bargainbin cereal okay that was a stupid line  but thats only because londons performance has melted my brain with its awfulnessbr br katherine heigl is cute and very briar rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film  she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines  who knows perhaps she was just reacting to and trying to neutralise jeremy londons flailing excesses but if thats the case she takes it too farbr br notable is arie verveen as poe  while his characters role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but its more than that  he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal twodimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe its just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen  whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missingbr br the rest of the characters are a faceless blur  there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde bestfriend whos a bit of a floozy the smitten local cop whos a bit of a dork the protective older man who perhaps has too much unfatherly interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn br br as with the distinct lack of blood for a horror movie issue none of the themes that they mention and that londons character mentions  so scathingly  in his attack on poes writing are followed through on as another reviewer said  there was potential here murder incest  genuinely shocking stuff but instead they skirt away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air  closing in on its victim  thencut to black this is fine in a noirish traditional horror indeed its expected and is fondly received when it happens  its a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup  but in descendant it just comes across as clumsy or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller  the horror of palingenesisdelusionmadness  or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both or neither something new and exciting but either way it fails dismally the only horror element of this entire movie is its epic dullnessbr br i think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when she chopped this thing up  there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script likewise the director  cinematographer  there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning but just ended up looking silly again fine in a noir but this was trying to be something elsebr br the whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned  omg how did this get made if i had been in the mood for some trash bagging unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch with the lights down low with the express intention of scaring myself silly  this is a very poor film and im afraid i cant recommend it to people not even for laughsbr br please please dont waste your time or money on this  either borrow a real horrorthriller film or find yourself a copy of poes fantastical tales either way youll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish
2778,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410162,how this film gains a 67 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 20 and clearly should rank among imdbs worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler throughbr br i love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this havent even heard of them since some havent been widely released yetbr br nicholas cage is a terrific actor  when he is in the right movies time after time ive seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mindnumbing films like con air the rock and faceoff when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufmans adaptation he is an incredible actorbr br bottom line  id rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again
12414,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113158,when i saw the previews for this movie i didnt expect much to begin with  around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and thats being generousbr br first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the godawful thing to endbr br secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlishlooking boy starts screaming pancakes at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves ive never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virusinfected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come frombr br i just simply couldnt believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains outbr br please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
