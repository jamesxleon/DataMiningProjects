33,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127388,skullduggery is a strange  strange film based on the novel  ye shall know them  by vercors  to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind  since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity  and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance  but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone  skullduggery simply isn t a very good film  for me  the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message  the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk  later it teeters into sci fi fable  by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics  the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great  too jarring  to overlook  they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled  disorganised movie  br    br   an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple  burt reynolds   one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame  susan clark   after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures  these primitive  long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man  there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man   the  missing link  in the evolution of apes into humans  or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual  or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics  the archaeologists call the tribe  the tropi  and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery  but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen  paul hubschmid  declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers  he questions whether the tropi are truly  human  and takes his argument to the courts  where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued  br    br   this was a very early film in reynolds  career  and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously  not that reynolds can be blamed   he has an impossible role  asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick  his character and the film are not relevant to each other  clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist  and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox  alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white  a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance  rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids  the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comicalÂ…  and that s just not the right idea  we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures  but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing  skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant  philosophical and stimulating  the honourable intentions are there for all to see  but the end result doesn t do them justice  a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless 
95,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist  sexist and homophobic all at once  while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated  atrocious performances  a cliche ridden screenplay  and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of  two scenes were especially offensive   the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man  could it really have been that gross   and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech s best friend  who is pretending to be russian  after he leaves the room she exclaims  f  king foreigners   so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris    br    br   jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen  and is astonishingly good looking  it s a shame he didn t learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film  and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia 
75,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941,some funny bits  but come bill  a film  quoting zeitgeist  keep the tv show and the interviews  but a film  i m probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film    i don t know  i laughed  disagreed  agreed    this film is very confusing and inconsistent  br    br   bill s a funny guy    but also very cocky    bill s rhetoric is similar to bill hicks  a brilliant comedian  but like many comedians  the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying  i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility  this might be just a personal taste  but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth  bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism  i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible  but the response to it cannot be sensible  it will create unnecessary turmoil  we can do better than just react to fundamentalism  his conclusion is that  we don t know  and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything  to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion  his humility that he only knows that he doesn t  is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense  br    br   i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist  the movie in bill s film  all the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing  zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship  it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources  astro mystic sources that reduce everything to  the stars say it all  seem to be from the middle ages  this film is a confusing statement from a confused  agnostic   agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as  we don t know   br    br   this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history  br    br   watch the film  it has hilarious interviews and bits  but please do not behave like bill  you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line  his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting  provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation   there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues 
10,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893406,i felt brain dead  i ll tell you  this is the worst film i have ever bought   in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name   the performances are so terrible they are laughable  the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire  the script promotes that kind of tv movie  stare into the middle distance kind of acting  the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani  they have one look each  and stick to it  plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this  the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes  avoid like a plague 
53,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220631,this film is overblown  predictable  pretentious  and hollow to its core  the settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure  the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue  tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in hart s war  tom  you can t give depth to a character simply by making your face blank  the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman  this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing 
31,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127388,this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film  it was a big wannabee  it wanted to be an edgy  nervous laughter  urban life affirming film  but it s more of a camera jerky  mess  it s a lot easier to imitate something else  than to create a real story with real characters  from the beginning  i couldn t care less about the characters or what they were involved in  they were always always hitting  pissing  or crying on each other  only  there wasn t any substance to what they were doing  the dialog between characters is meant to be hip  revealing  instead it comes out trite  and one scene after another is predictable  i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie  so i could be wrong 
82,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0760179,let s be honest shall we  al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus  it s a hook  make no mistake  al gore is a politician  three years ago he was busted ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid  a yugo  or even a gm metro but a lincoln  go google it if you like   or how about the fact that mr  gore   his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel guzzling jets to attend the premiers of  an inconvenient truth   so much for conservation huh  al  anyway  it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at  an inconvenient truth    discover the main fundamental flaw  while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed  global warming  there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it  for example  i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot   they can point out an automobile which is not running right  but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why  generally not  a second flaw  just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago  the toilet wasn t even invented yet   what did they have  a june bug in a match box  hell  even 50 60 years ago  therefore  how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is  getting warmer  when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best  or that man is the sole cause of it  the answer is we don t   science is never a consensus  thirty years ago  time magazine did a cover proclaiming a  new ice age   the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions  solar activity   el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed  global warming   finally  what al gore fails to adequately address is  even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al   implement everything he recommends  how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can t even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism  answer  it s wishful thinking  mr  gore   you being a former vp of the usa know it  if the folks who produced  an inconvenient truth  were really honest  they would have titled their film  al gore wants attention   but what i d really like is for someone to ask the former vp this  why were two of the planet s biggest polluters  aka china   india  exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords  anyway  i hear the producers of a i t are working on their next film entitled  gnomes  fairies   elves  our endangered friends  
37,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080486,minor spoilers  br    br   well i just sat up late and watched this film  mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton s earlier work like  boyz n the hood   however  i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived  clich d  so called  message  movies   br    br   the acting is mainly poor  pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors   take note   the situations hard to swallow   rape victim becomes overnight lesbian    please    but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of  by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation  making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one dimensional players  br    br   not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural  sexual and political ignorance  as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems  it s message is contradictory  resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion  as for the films conclusion i found it predictable  embarrassing  exploitative and mildly offensive  for a film called  higher learning  i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again  br    br   if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire  american history x     unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life 
22,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948,the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar  but superior   the legend of suriyothai  set box office records  the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest  pedestrian scripts and story development on film  br    br   the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma  gary stretch  whose vengeance for this father s murderer drives him to shipwrecked  captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria  cindy burbridge  with the consent of her father phillipe  john rhys davies   a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses  there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong  dom hetrakul   after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness  are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards  only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan  yoe hassadeevichit  reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat  oliver pupart  to take over the rule of siam  yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families  tong s wife and children and fernando s now firm love affair with maria  with the expected consequences  br    br   the acting  with the exception of john rhys davies  is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp  the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog  making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles  the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas  but if it is visual splendor you re after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching  it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions  it is just the basics that are missing  grady harp
66,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941,nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be  in the movies  they are prepared to do almost anything  br    br   i m not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash  after all  the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of   no   i m talking about those who are more than willing to co star with a badly made hand puppet called george  now that is embarrassing    br    br   a bio electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake  wellington meffert   george  who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair  is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device  a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball  that  when ingested  can reverse character disorders  br    br   edward s personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals  but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects  fearing that there may still be side effects  his evil assistant julie  debbie laster   however  has no such qualms  and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs  inevitably  they all turn into hideous killer mutants  br    br   with bargain basement special effects  a cast totally devoid of talent  and a plot that is almost impossible to follow  i took notes as i watched the film  and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate   nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue  br    br   this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie  tony  bruce morton   a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
