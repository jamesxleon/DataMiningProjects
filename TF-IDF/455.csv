",this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these peopletheres just no comparisonbr br even three days after watching this for some reason i still dont know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie iswas its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existencebr br this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good its an embarrassment i dont know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i dont know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of moviesbr br that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are badbr br but thisthis crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes beforebr br every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audiencebr br butand let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow twogallons of draino or i will do it for himbr br if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through thisbr br stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now

",i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even overbr br i love bad movies to me ed wood is a genius i thought bloody murder jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good however there is not a single good thing i can say about this filmbr br the plot is basically non existent if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this moviebr br the special effects are badbr br the acting is badbr br the two leads are attractive but thats all there isbr br i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarkingyahoocom to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it i will tell you anythingbr br i love bad movies and i love horror and i love new inventive movies i even love horror porn stuff like hostel which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever madebr br and before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead but actually bought a copy of it

",i just viewed this movie last night and i dont think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mindbr br the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson i will think of tinseltown which is a very bad thingbr br i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman i thought that it at least wouldnt be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrongbr br this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutesbr br the characters are paperthin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they dont even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to gilligans islandbr br the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national lampoons favorite deadly sins the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who cant find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this moviebr br the actors try kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i dont think it was the actors fault because they have bad materialbr br go watch the national lampoons movie but stay away from this movie

",from the first time i saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography i thought this guy this friend of the scwarz must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in br br not 5 feet tall not that its his fault br br at any rating i turned on the movie one cool night in tucson out on the second storydeck with a good cigar and let it roll at that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so i needed a good diversion but as bad as the movie wasi totally enjoyed it with a bottle of merlot too i might admit br br truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good its not that it tries too hard to be cool or that its so close to hitting the mark for an action filmits frantic and then truly clueless then frantic again its the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene wow i never felt safer in my life warm and happy too i was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase due to less production in the summer monthsanywho br br the direction was uninspired the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or rechoreographed and tightened up the sound was off the delivery didnt hit you it just kept on going the other way the locals of that village that they were in the town rather were off cue they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even stare into the camera lens like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer br br i feel bad because columbu i just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in america as well as for his own countrymen br br however barettas island is very lethargic and unbelievable even still i like it a lot my now xwife hates it but i love it br br the funny thing is i am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies i like or even love all in all i like franco so there it is br br as a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to videob movies or bad movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out the big sweat 1991 with robert z daryou know the big guy from tango  cash the big sweat a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be on crutches and at the end of the big sweat i think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits good fun br br but all in all not as good as barettas island i gave it a 1 and an overall rating of awful for awfulgood b movie im waiting for the sequel maybe like barettas revenge on montazuma franco takes a mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co or barettas powder war where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically genesplice and create a hybrid super bug insect that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on he could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature right

",ever since i started visiting this site and voting for movies i have never given any movie a rating of 1 even the disturbing dance workout with barbie got a 2 there is a reason for thisbr br any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie i have to stop and ask myself the following question is this movie really as bad as the horrific soulsucking beast that is theodore rex and ive never been able to answer yesbr br i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said hey lets remake blade runner with barney in the harrison ford role and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film furthermore i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadnt gone strait to video this is that rare monster a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults id ask what were they thinking but in this case it might actually be redundantbr br anyhow all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if youre one of the five or six rabid fans of howard the duck or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time or you want to really punish yourself

",i didnt know much about this movie before i watched it but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested what i didnt know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of newage blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or dramabr br marlee matlin is in the movie in order to give this new age symposium some sort of a storyline her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speakers thoughts so we wont die of boredom matlin has a real job as a photographer unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all means to them the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india i assume but i think he showed up for the wrong filmbr br it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film there is a lot of whizbang cgi were supposed to be impressed with cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds because the filmmakers have apparently seen flubber one too many timesbr br people in the movie say that the arawak people on san salvador thought columbuss ship the pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before as if people today had any way possible way of knowing of course they leave out all of that information and just say columbuss ships were invisible to the indians in america the film takes many such arrogant leaps thomas young did a doubleslit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time and a wave some of the time of course youd never know this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that atoms can be particles and waves and that must mean that people can pass through walls walk on water and never grow old if they just wish upon a star then im sure marlee matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough im being sarcastic but this film is chockfull of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them dont really holdbr br these are new age kooks who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation zero point energy crystal healing etc if these snakeoil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling couldnt they just wish their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film we get to listen to another nameless man with no credentials that we know of talk on his couch in front of a fireplace or tv screen about how he creates his own life every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face these people take themselves way too seriously some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because theres a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach screaming im not touching you im not touching you a moral relativist in the movie claims that theres really no such thing as good or bad so apparently its ok that hitler gassed millions of jews to death another person says that there is no such thing as love its just a chemical and that we really dont love people were just addicted to the chemical rush we have when were around them i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many yearsbr br we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception seeing everything like robocop they evaluate if women are cows dogs or foxes and a sexual position pops onto the scree marlee matlin gets drunk at the wedding shes supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because shes a beautiful and unique snowflakebr br i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their preconceived notions perhaps in this review im only seeing what i want to see but i truly wanted to see these people get pies to the face and it never happenedbr br if youve never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before you may find them interesting but there are better sources for all of the ideas here if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the heisenberg uncertainty principle go see the man who wasnt there if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory read hyperspace by michio kaku if you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals see waking life although it can feel boring selfimportant and pretentious at times all in all you should go and read quantum psychology or prometheus rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this moviebr br i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 but this one was a very easy for me 110 starsbr br the movies title is true the people in this film dont know  hands down the worst movie ive ever seen

",why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a moviebr br i think sports movies fall into two categories well made movies about the human spirit and competitions and by the swordbr br honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be a touching drama for trying to be your best in life an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick in the end it didnt do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of itbr br for the record i also am a fencing instructor and now i am officially as bad as the rest but putting bad fencing in a movie doesnt make it bad automatically i mean look at star wars episodes 46 good movies bad fencing i liked those movies but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effortbr br dont be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing this is just a bad movie in the end this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cellsbr br when i see a movie and am forced to think man i wish i was watching the mighty ducks i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back

",my dear lordwhat a movie lets talk about the special effects first dont get me wrong here i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past mainly the 60s so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60sbr br what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message acting is secondary effects are secondary i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies however in a movies like this bad acting incredibility etc add up to make a bad movie even worse  thats what happened for me with the celestine prophecybr br my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way  the movie failed to do sobr br there could be one single reason to watch this one though if you really love cheesy movies itll be the right one for you if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten starsbr br by the way three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there like critical mass look up the comments on that one  hilarious the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree
