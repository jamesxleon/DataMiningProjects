watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video  this has to be the worst of all movies  with bloody special effects  what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again  and people running around screaming from left  then to right  then back again  it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes  instead  it is dragged out very long  it is very  very x5 low budget  many scenes were way  way too long  narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking  this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos  red zone cuba  benji and godzilla vs  megalon despite their higher budgets  10 snoozes  try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet  avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob  the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues  epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc  ad infinitum   infinity 10\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","2. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948\n","Review: quite possibly the worst movie i ve ever seen  i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes  the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners  don t get me wrong  i love silly  stupid movies just as much as the next gal  but the whole premise  writing and humor stunk  it seemed to me that they were going for a  napoleon dynamite  feel   strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience  instead  it ended up being forced  awkward and weird  br    br   the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she  and sissy spacek  had signed up for this horrible thing  br    br   thank gosh i didn t pay for it \n","\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","3. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948\n","Review: while some performances were good victoria rowell  adrienne barbeau  and the two italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative  the emphasis on the girlfriend s racial background was handled clumsily at best  and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes  not as real people  i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny  i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie  and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb  very disappointed in this movie  and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it  based on the faulty connection to garden state  which is a far funnier  more inventive  and touching movie than this one  i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church  which was so wooden and by the numbers that i nearly left  and some in the audience actually did  that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard  which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened  i really don t like being misled to spend my money so uselessly \n","\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","4. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948\n","Review: despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie  i really liked it  this one however  how to sum it up in one word   this movie is  and here comes the word   crap  br    br   but let s look at it part by part  here is the plot  finally the old queen has been removed from her castle  but her successor  snow white has problems of another sort  the court jester  father of her son  has gone astray  as the super  spliss  goes to the extreme  to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair  in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi  otto walkees  who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin  br    br   the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend  where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay   br    br   yes  there are some good jokes  even for fans of the first part  or for fans of any of the other actors  it s really not worth buying the the dvd  believe me   br    br   the only thing  that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion  are the performances of some of the actors  that s why i gave the move 3 10  sadly  the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story  br    br   for example  at one point  they even cross over in our reality  and sadly   they don t do anything funny while being here   br    br   still  a lot of great actors in this movie  otto waalkes  ralf schmitz  martin schneider  nina hagen  cosma shiva hagen   especially funny   r diger hoffmann as the mirror  helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren t able to bring this really bad script to life   br    br   maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it s not worth the money   br    br   i even regret renting the movie \n","\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","5.

the original movie this is the remake of  some 1950s film   but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization  br    br   a major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element  and winds up teaching children at an rotc school  unfortunately  the major is daman wayans    so the children are in for a world of annoying  humorless asininity  can wayans whip these losers into shape  can they get him to become a little more human  the film bombs as most wayans films do  with only a few sparkling moments  william hickey gets about one minute of screen time  fair too little  this charming old man  known best to me as a  tales from the crypt  actor  known best to you as uncle louis from  christmas vacation   shines every moment he s on screen  which isn t much here  br    br   bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker  which fits him perfectly  i wouldn t mind slightly more bam bam  but i think he carried the role of  biker  about as far as it could be carried for a military film  br    br   and then there s the attractive teacher  who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly  has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with  she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate  i m not sure which  though it would seem  stupid  since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough   br    br   wayans had one shining moment  a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves  including a very nice  robot    and with the help of music from 2 live crew  this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle  br    br   seriously  avoid this film  if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes  rent or buy  ernest goes to camp   at least he s a lovable loser  and actually funny  maybe if major payne had fought a badger i d feel better  but he didn t  forget payne  forget wayans    you can do so much better \n","URL2: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949379\n","Review2: i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie  but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen  br    br   first of all  the pace is incredibly slow  so it seems much longer than it is  and it s not short  i m sure when jane austen wrote the book  she made it several pages long  filled it with description  and didn t intend for people to read in in one day  or it might drag and lose it s appeal  which  emma  most certainly did  now  sense and sensibility  had this flaw of a slow pace  but at least it had lively lines to make up for it  as well as some good performances  br    br   that brings me to flaw  2  which is of course  the acting  while i don t happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film  i am sure they are capable of good work  but i didn t see much of it in this movie  it was like people were trying too hard to be witty  too hard to be  upper class   too hard to be british  well  some of them   so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people  br    br    3  the cast  as i said  seemed only like actors  and not actually like the people they were playing  maybe that s a good thing  because the people they played really weren t all that nice  why did everybody like emma  for example  sure  she was nice to the rich  handsome people in front of them  but she was an awful gossip behind their backs  if her friends were  ugly   then she didn t even bother to go behind their backs  so  why is this girl so great  why do people have to tell stories   just to make her laugh   of course the snob couldn t even do that right  i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow  and her  emma  did not exactly change my opinion  br    br   well  it s easy to see that i did not care for this one  i m sure it s a lovely book and all  but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen  and  emma  is one of them \n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Pair 2:\n","URL1: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360813\n","Review1: i confess  emma  in my opinion  is the single greatest novel ever written  it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be  jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here  br    br   unfortunately  this is at best a palimpsest  br    br   comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable  that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch  br    br   there are some good elements here  kate berkinsale  having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm  clearly emma s smarter spiritual twin  is a wonderful emma  raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill  the production is handsome  but the interiors are far too dark  br    br   however  there are several major problems  the first is mark strong  first of all  he doesn t look right for mr  knightley  this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson  it s badly out of tune  br    br   the second problem is one of length  simply put  the film is much too short  to get the right kind of feel  it would need to be twice as long  br    br   finally  and most significantly  there is the quality of the adaptation  austen is an adapter s dream  all the dialogue is there already  it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly  andrew davies seems to think otherwise  first  this is a rather gloomy film  and the last thing emma should be is gloomy  more significantly  davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast  what planet  or minor work of thomas hardy  is this come from  it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel  and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon  perfection  br    br   watch the paltrow version  or watch kate in cold comfort farm \n","URL2: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949379\n","Review2: i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366292\n","Review1: in director sooraj barjatya s vivah 20 something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure  small town girl his father has selected for him to marry  drawn to her innocence and simplicity  shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he s met her at her home in madhupur  and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor  the marriage is fixed for six months later  and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young  budding love  their geographical distance notwithstanding  but amrita  who s been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents  death  is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage  and then  it s up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain  barjatya s new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise  but sadly  the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated  even more far fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps  and the problem is clear   you just can t relate to such squeaky clean characters who don t have one bad bone in their bodies  there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films  and timing is one such important factor  twenty five years ago  perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch  but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp  perhaps the film s only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish  you can make out right away that the filmmaker s intention is not to deceive  judging both by barjatya s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world  he believes in his good as gold characters  he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps but alas  he s unable to translate his vision to the screen  it s difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are   shahid and amrita  both virtuous and virginal   i mean  think about it  the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film  barjatya may think he s returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah  but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film  or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry  because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah  those pairs had mischief and masti  shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story  the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s style tunes that only further slacken the film s deadening pace  but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn t work for me  it s because i m not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya s story  to some perhaps  vivah will give hope  that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere  but i m a little cynical i guess  so  give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun  give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya  i ll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain  but save me from these dullards  you know  some marriages aren t made in heaven  this one s vivah \n","URL2: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0688816\n","Review2: this movie is truly boring  it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why  it s not because it s critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality  i would never want to pay money to watch this  i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china  it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself  the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there s plenty of them  the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad  i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film  the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good  i can t see any reason why people would like this  this is not an art film it s of waste of celluloid  that s if they actually shot it on film   which they didn t
