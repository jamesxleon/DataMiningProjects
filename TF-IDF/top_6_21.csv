21,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948,i should love this movie   the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me   the movie makes working class people look low and cheap  the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy   barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family   i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching   i really don t like the story line   just a personal preference  thank you
93,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,popeye and big foot     popeye s engine company     getting popeye s goat   1 2 br    br   i used to lap these up as a kid but  catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back to back now i e  several years later  they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas  1953    i can see how they don t hold up all that well  the character of popeye isn t exactly sympathetic to begin with  olive oyl distinctly overbearing and bluto s antics failed to elicit much interest either   in short  the scripts were alarmingly thin  fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot  they re strictly juvenile fare  yet i doubt today s kids would even have the patience to stick with them   furthermore  the animation style is unattractive  br    br   taking each short per se  i guess they improved from one to the other  after the initial shock  one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were  so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot   popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief  hardly original  i know  but always an amusing ploy   one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience 
89,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785025,this is a movie about making a movie  such movies may be entertaining  but they need some substance  to do so  it did not happen here  i am afraid  mr coppola did not inherit his father s skills  unfortunately  neither did his sister  who can however make movies which one might watch   br    br   i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews   br    br   let s see  the lead male actor  supposedly a director  is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says  the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes  the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element  the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks    would that be enough  br    br   i regretted every single moment i watched this movie  a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie  it s as if a fran ois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney    br    br   brazil  some other classic sf movies  you must be really joking   
74,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941,the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn t work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow  julie   gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her  br    br   however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that s basically it  watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest  trust me you aren t missing much 
24,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948,quite possibly the worst movie i ve ever seen  i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes  the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners  don t get me wrong  i love silly  stupid movies just as much as the next gal  but the whole premise  writing and humor stunk  it seemed to me that they were going for a  napoleon dynamite  feel   strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience  instead  it ended up being forced  awkward and weird  br    br   the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she  and sissy spacek  had signed up for this horrible thing  br    br   thank gosh i didn t pay for it 
30,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127388,it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb  because i would not have hesitated  in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars   br    br   i  like many others  bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it  it could be good    no chance  this film was shocking  imagine a movie length  the bold and the beautiful   well  primal instinct did not even come close to that good  and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length  the bold and the beautiful    br    br   michael madsen  how could you do this to us  the worst part is  i didn t fast forward a bit  i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke  that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film  br    br   where do i start     directing   zero stars  screenplay   zero stars  acting   zero stars  cinematography   zero stars  digital effects   zero stars  production design   zero stars  make up   zero stars  casting   zero stars  editing   zero stars  trailer   half a star  graphic design   half a star  dvd menu   half a star  br    br   however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is  so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film  just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list 
49,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114366,brief summary  this movie demeans everyone it touches  that means you  br    br   first off  let me say i m not a purist  and this might have been funny for a few minutes  the impersonations are not bad  but overall it s just dull and excruciatingly not funny  a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again  br    br   it s clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked laurel and hardy  the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history  or their talents  this is what offended me the most  br    br   of course  my daughter liked it  so i m also a failure as a parent
