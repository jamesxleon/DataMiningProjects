http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375560,scotty  grant cramer  who would go on to star in the great b movie  killer klowns from outer space   agrees to help three middle aged guys learn how to  dialog  the ladies in this bad  80 s comedy  not bad as in  80 s lingo  which meant good  bad as in bad  with no likable characters  including  but not limited to  a kid who s the freakiest looking guy since  friday the 13th part 2   a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her  and the token fat slob  because after all what would an  80 s sex comedy be without a fat slob   well this one has two  this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of  80 s sex comedies  and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel  br    br   my grade d   br    br   eye candy  too numerous to count  you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point  think  bachlor party  but not as funny  and very disturbing  br    br   where i saw it  comcast moviepass
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101327,this movie is complete crap  avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs  it is rambling and incoherent  i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70 s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty  i like being shocked  but i need a coherent story  however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you  the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang  i mean its just plain hard to sit through  not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly  please  i know the cover is interesting  what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman s bare ass but don t waste your time or money as you won t get either back 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949379,i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie  but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen  br    br   first of all  the pace is incredibly slow  so it seems much longer than it is  and it s not short  i m sure when jane austen wrote the book  she made it several pages long  filled it with description  and didn t intend for people to read in in one day  or it might drag and lose it s appeal  which  emma  most certainly did  now  sense and sensibility  had this flaw of a slow pace  but at least it had lively lines to make up for it  as well as some good performances  br    br   that brings me to flaw  2  which is of course  the acting  while i don t happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film  i am sure they are capable of good work  but i didn t see much of it in this movie  it was like people were trying too hard to be witty  too hard to be  upper class   too hard to be british  well  some of them   so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people  br    br    3  the cast  as i said  seemed only like actors  and not actually like the people they were playing  maybe that s a good thing  because the people they played really weren t all that nice  why did everybody like emma  for example  sure  she was nice to the rich  handsome people in front of them  but she was an awful gossip behind their backs  if her friends were  ugly   then she didn t even bother to go behind their backs  so  why is this girl so great  why do people have to tell stories   just to make her laugh   of course the snob couldn t even do that right  i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow  and her  emma  did not exactly change my opinion  br    br   well  it s easy to see that i did not care for this one  i m sure it s a lovely book and all  but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen  and  emma  is one of them 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845463,your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video  not film  the story is convoluted  and the production is amazingly sloppy  note  for example  that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in vermont  where they ve gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony  the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees  their ceremony   in vermont   takes place in a garden of tropical plants  including palms  which wouldn t last five minutes in the new england climate  on yet another airplane trip  the establishing shot depicts a fedex cargo plane taking off  presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage  as for the plot  this movie expects you to believe that victor  the devoutly christian brother of arthur  is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay  not only that  but the pastor eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed  to purge their souls of sin   apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten commandments  were it not for jamie brett gabel  who is surprisingly effective as arthur  this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463392,alright  i got passed the horrible acting  i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren t moving  i got passed the weaves  i got passed the colored contacts  br    br   this is what killed it for me  in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing  lisa raye and monica calhoun stand up and  and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying   whoa  whoa  whoa  hold up  let s chill out here for a hot second   i am a fan of the western movie genre  and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood s movies  br    br   if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating  please tell me another movie that s worse than gang of roses  br    br   i m through 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372873,this is one seriously disturbed movie  even though the boys deserved some of what they got     the sadistic gruesome executions were  slightly  over the top  the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot  br    br   at the beginning of the movie  there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair  but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security  before the joy of what was to come   br    br   the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled   and  where is the batman    kim basinger could have screamed   br    br   now that would have been cool 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460912,because it is  that s why  this is the same jealous daughter kills people flick we ve seen a billion times  rosanna arquette makes anything worth watching  and mandy schaffer s brief nude scene  after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film  at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile  but not quite  br    br     out of     
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199650,i wanted to love this movie  how could i not love it  cary grant  jayne mansfield  stanley donen  all icons in their own way  however  the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me  her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open  not believing my eyes or ears  i could barely make it through one viewing  that s how hideous she is in this  br    br   cary  gorgeous and in fine dramatic form  jayne  adorable  endearing  and obviously having a ball  the supporting cast does alright  and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning  retro elegance  br    br   then you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness  a deadness  a cluelessness that simply defies belief  who told this creature she could act   oy vey  people 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190834,a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life  one as a  happily  married man with a ten year oldish child  the other as a sex fiend  the bulk of the documentary like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist  listening to his story and intelligently probing him  nastassja s role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes  if she had  i would have rated this movie a big fat  f   as it is  it rates an f   implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored  it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage   diary of a sex addict  falls into the category of films that once one has seen it  one wishes that one hadn t 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995060,this infamous ending to koen wauters  career came to my attention through the  night of bad taste   judging by the comment index i wasn t the first and i am not to be the last person in western europe to learn that this musician  undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene  even the dutch agree on that  tried to be an actor  whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged   br    br   in  intensive care  he s quite likable  but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating  no one can blame him  it deserves its ranking in verheyen s hall of fame by all means   standards  the story of the murderous maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and wrathful has been told dozens of times before  and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography  br    br    ic contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses  the pace is dull  the tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score  for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody  followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders  which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them  the sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing  the couple from amsterdamned could have made it work  though  while dealing with the couple subject   the whole subplot between wauters and the girl does not work  a more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims to be  who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse  i will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning  for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces  as a matter of fact  most of them do  the ones i recall where obvious for the genre   a pretty nurse and two cops   br    br   hence  in a slasher  the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself  the  anti   hero has to take out the villain  mostly through clever thinking  for former red berets don t often get parts in these films  they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer  translated to the events  wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress   br    br   no people  i am not finished  this is not how the story goes  wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to  a clockwork orange   so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains  though this method ensures the killer s death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets  the doctor survives in order to enable ic to reach the 80 min mark  br    br   i should have made my point by now  intensive care is a bad movie  which can only be enjoyed by bad taste lovers  who can verify verheyen s catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it  for example  the  unintended  parody value of the doctor s clown mask  halloween  and the final confrontation in the park  the chase at the end of friday the 13th   br    br   however  let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give ic a little credit  george kennedy is not one of them  all he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor french actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand in  he could have played his naked gun part again  to end up as beef  but with a longer screen time  the finale may be one of them  i had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence  it is good for a laugh  br    br   name one good truly point about intensive care     koen wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career  it makes me wonder how many editions of the paris dakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses  br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887719,okay the promos promised a comedy and people few  went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing  or for that matter of any year  because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some more br    br   okay coming to jawani diwani br    br   review in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it s annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitley br    br   cringeworthy dialogues  comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes br    br   direction is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here  luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it s touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203408,it was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words  yet very naive on the corporate world  the justice department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win  the real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting  yet every bit as sinister  i seriously doubt any corp would actually kill someone directly  even the mod is more indirect these days  in the real world  they do kill people with nicotine  pollution  additives  poisons  etc  this movie must have been developed by some garage geeks  i think  and the studios didn t know the difference  they just wanted something to capitalize on the microsoft antitrust case in the news 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369,chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films  the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect  but fails painfully on all other fronts  the actors all play extremely silly caricatures  you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny  the plot is predictable  and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow  towards the end  the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films  including shabby larger than life special effects and a  well  yet another  ghost with a godzilla head  maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp  br    br   it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with   in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula  they won t be able to do it again  the cash cow is now dead as a dodo 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361179,this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness  while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony  it certainly can t promote winning bridge  so the satire didn t work for me  but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway  especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film  it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match  not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring  there is a referee hovering between the contestants  and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings  at one point he even enumerates  one    two    three    four     as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event  and people were glued to their radios for it all  a common event for championship boxing matches  that spoof worked very well indeed  br    br   unfortunately  few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire  paul lukas doesn t have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast  lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren t given good enough lines  glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film  but she practically disappears thereafter  what a waste of talent 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091631,this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film  they should have let it remain that way  br    br   what a colossal bomb  douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here  cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus  what i ll do to that hungarian  br    br   the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror   fairbanks  now  let s fast forward to 300 years later  where grable  just married to the count romero  faces a similar situation  when on her wedding night  there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers  br    br   romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives  he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks  the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good news an enraged romero has annulled the marriage  br    br   this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948  as harry davenport  a veteran supporting player who is in it  died in 1949  this must have been his last film  what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career  br    br   walter abel co stars but he can do little with such poor writing  the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age  i can t fathom what fairbanks was wearing 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385,god  i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called  cartoons   br    br   since anime became popular  the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a 5 year old lazy ass style of drawing  kappa mikey  or some cheep japanese animation rip off   usually messing up classic characters  no wonder anime is beating american cartoons   br    br   they are not even trying anymore   br    br   oh  i just heard of this last night  i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in 2005 well  i never knew the uk was so up to date with current shows 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202458,i love a good sappy love story  and i m a guy  but when i rented  love story  i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw s character  br    br   ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes  when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn t help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care  if she didn t die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court  br    br   people love this movie but it s one of the worst of the 70 s 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0809620,i haven t seen the first two   only this one which is called primal species in england  i don t think i ll be bothering to look them out though  br    br   this is an awful film  terrible acting  bad dialogue  cheap rubber monsters  everything about it is so nasty  the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones  especially one called polchak  who is an incredible jerk  no one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army  he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off   i was having nightmares he was going to survive  the colonel was rubbish too   all moody pouts and clueless shouting  and the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno  i was waiting for her to take her glasses off  shake her hair and turn into a vamp  but she didn t  pity that  as it would ve livened the film up no end  br    br   didn t roger corman used to make half decent films once 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360813,i confess  emma  in my opinion  is the single greatest novel ever written  it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be  jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here  br    br   unfortunately  this is at best a palimpsest  br    br   comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable  that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch  br    br   there are some good elements here  kate berkinsale  having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm  clearly emma s smarter spiritual twin  is a wonderful emma  raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill  the production is handsome  but the interiors are far too dark  br    br   however  there are several major problems  the first is mark strong  first of all  he doesn t look right for mr  knightley  this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson  it s badly out of tune  br    br   the second problem is one of length  simply put  the film is much too short  to get the right kind of feel  it would need to be twice as long  br    br   finally  and most significantly  there is the quality of the adaptation  austen is an adapter s dream  all the dialogue is there already  it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly  andrew davies seems to think otherwise  first  this is a rather gloomy film  and the last thing emma should be is gloomy  more significantly  davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast  what planet  or minor work of thomas hardy  is this come from  it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel  and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon  perfection  br    br   watch the paltrow version  or watch kate in cold comfort farm 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446685,we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books  while not particularly accurate adaptations  these movies were nonetheless excellent films  some great examples are the harry potter series  the lord of the rings trilogy  and  to a lesser extent  almost every disney film ever made  however  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies  not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l engle s fan base  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting  acting  special effects and  ultimately  respect for the audience  mind you  i m not trying to be mean  on the contrary  i went into this affair with an open mind  i figured that a made for t v  movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script  after all  the star wars spin off ewoks was decent  if a little silly  come to think of it  the original star wars was made on  a lunch money budget   and look where it took george lucas  however  from the first scene onward  disappointment started enveloping me as if i d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering   br    br   the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997  a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic   mrs  whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time  the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief  aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  star trek  first contact and radio  as our favorite star turned mentor  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow  that s right  a crow  moreover  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight year old  the majestic half man  half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle  had i been five  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life  the worst part is the fact that when it spoke  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single  unmoving cheek  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t  br    br   having gotten the most painful part out of the way  i must go on to the tear inducing one  the characters  the acting  and the story  i  personally  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films  plain hair  glasses  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable  she was always a slightly anxious  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua  in the film  she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever  in fact  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr  jenkins  her school principal  who continuously has to deal with her  calvin  the kind  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock  the irony is horrible  as for the memorable happy medium  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  above gender  and likes to look at  funny  things  such as girls falling off of swings  the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace  mrs  whatsit and the man with red eyes  nicknamed  the dude with red eyes  due to his complete reinvention as a character   br    br   the story is a mess  a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  which didn t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book  yet kept the sole of the original work  here  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed  as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen  the flat nosed wookies of ixchel  who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks  tear the spine up  as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like camazotz was  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil   br    br   i am very sorry that this film exists  i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad  it s the way the characters are written that ruins it  a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg  enhanced at industrial light and magic  scored by john williams  given its sound at skywalker sound  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox  in its current state  the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people  even madeleine l engle thought it was bad  the book was good  the film was bad  and mrs  whatsit was ugly  br    br   score  0 1 10  if i could   br    br   pros  br    br   they got the names right   br    br   cons   br    br   it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation  script  acting and special effects  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book  oh  and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle  some might say that this symbolizes high adventure  i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn t even bother to photoshop meg s arm on properly 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145660,this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about  gigli   that ben and jen flop earlier this summer   the order  was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes  rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film  appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot  now  i m a heath ledger fan   10 things i hate about you    a knight s tale  and particularly his supporting role in  monster s ball    but my man needs to find himself a better agent  keep accepting scripts like  the order  and  four feathers  and he s going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion  br    br   here are the problems i had with the film  firstly  the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with  well  much of anything  plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope  while mildly interesting  did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters  the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best  secondly  please don t insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory  we had manufactured angst  manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of  matrix reloaded  with skull numbing techno music  rather than developing character  these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were  a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing adolescents in the seats  thirdly  and most importantly  this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept  we have scandal  we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play  why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone s background  we learn a little about alex  but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days  a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past  and alex is the most developed  if you can call it that  character in the entire film  br    br   as the cliche goes nowadays  if you re going to see one movie this year  make sure it s not this one  there s about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair  the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i m rather fond of  br    br   1 out of 10  i m disappointed  file this one firmly under  had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing   heath my man  go back to monster s ball like cameos  they really suit you 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0197903,i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie  which is the only reason i went to see it  another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away  his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary  br    br    yuk   br    br   unless you re a neil young fan or live in near  greendale   if the latter you know the real name   skip this movie  it s mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker  it has no discernible plot  the music is merely ok  and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be  br    br   i don t need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away  br    br   i d give this a 1 5 10  but that s just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie  it wasn t worth the  6  i could rent a video camera and drive around  greendale  and make a better movie myself  br    br   if you want to see a  good  environmental message movie with no plot  go rent koyaanisqatsi 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028358,my comments on this movie have been deleted twice  which i find pretty offending  since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people  please be tolerant of other people s opinion  obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood  so ill change my comment completely  br    br   i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons  br    br   subject  one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions  one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker  so making a movie about his life  which obviously includes his  ideas  is a thing one should be extremely careful with  or preferably  don t do at all  wisdom starts with knowing what you don t know  one might think this is not a review of the movie itself  but the movie is not about an imaginary character  it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had has great influence on the world of yesterday  today and tomorrow  if someone tells a story about a tomato  i can express my thoughts about the story itself  but also about the chosen subject  the tomato  there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts  specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken  br    br   screenplay  one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents  why  it distracts from what it should be about  nietzsche and the truths he found  it doesn t help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time  come on  make it proper english or better yet  german  even mel gibson got that part right    letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passion  br    br   secondly  it is well over acted  br    br   3d  assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche  bad casting  br    br   4th  facts are way off  br    br   and so on  its a waste of celluloid 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463392,the version of this film i saw was titled  horror rises from the tomb   the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he s playing abanazer in a church hall panto  he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant  i think he s a descendant  as he s also played by naschy returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician s head and body  which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him  in an attempt to stop him  er  rising from the tomb  br    br   obviously  once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die  like all good magicians  abanazer here has a lovely assistant  this one s played by another spanish horror great  the beautiful helga line  like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off  there s a lot of nudity in this film  and not just female   we even get to see naschy s paunchy body  which isn t a pretty sight  i can tell you  most of the film s sex angle is laughably gratuitous  there s one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they ve possessed  br    br   it s also pretty gory in places   notably a herschell gordon lewis esquire moment where line plunges her hands into a man s chest to remove his heart  br    br   the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end  they re quickly scared off by a fire though  and don t bother coming back  which is a shame  the scene where the zombies rise  however  is the film s most ludicrously inept moment  it all happens in long shot  and we haven t really got a clue what s happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance  there are several rubbish moments like this  thanks largely to poor editing  when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschy s head there s a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever  br    br   all in all  not a great horror film  but entertaining enough  of course  the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces  for all i know  the original spanish version could be a masterpiece   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066390,suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it   not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor  josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters  do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366292,all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop  many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events  yet really  the techniques used  as many have already mentioned  were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole  br    br   as far as the plot is concerned  it was lacklustre  unimaginative  implausible and convoluted  you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would  br    br   granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action    looks can only carry a film so far  the action is poor and intermittent  a few punches thrown here and there  and a final gunfight towards the end  nothing really to write home about  br    br   as others have said   bad  movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are  bad   you revel in that fact  this film  however  is a void  it s nothing  br    br   furthermore  if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way   requiem for a dream    trainspotting    fear and loathing in las vegas  and  candy  are just a few examples  though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like  go   overall  both serious and funny  and  halfbaked   br    br   on a final note  the one possibly redeeming line in this movie  delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from  lock  stock and two smokling barrels   to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by  loaded  is vile  br    br   overall  i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0155732,this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen  i love almereyda s nadja  but this is just absolute dreck  aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material  jared harris is particularly bad  but no one in this is remotely good  the plot is a joke  but not the haha kind  i don t even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad  please erase the last hour and a half of my life  how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465624,i doubt this will ever even be a cult film  i loved gram parsons to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less  what could have been clever and moving was campy  it was devoid of the music that made gram and had more filler than cheap dog food  there was no background on gram or the colorful people of that era  the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of gram s and all the versions of his  afterlife adventures  i have heard  rock and roll is full of tales  good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt  they can be great stories even though exaggerated  however  this movie took a good story and turned into tripe  stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull  somehow  i am tempted to steal every copy of grand theft parsons  head out to the desert and burn them all 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075781,another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces  especially the army  for every disaster since the great flood  anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is  uniforms  equipment  sets  and mannerisms are all wrong   and of course  all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots   blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity  most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years  uses every cliche   rumor  and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel   the truth is  no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses   ps this is not new  war is not fun and i know wwii  korean  and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments  too   and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them   sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427038,i m starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie  it s the first time i ve tried doing that  but i m having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks  that s not because it s intense but because it s bad  br    br   it s almost painfully tedious and unbelievable  especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother ryan  colm feore  is on screen being tragic and bitchy  self indulgent and self pitying  this would have been a much better movie if they d just left that character out of the story  br    br   he adds nothing but mawkish  maudlin  very irritating melodrama  maybe somebody decided that if they couldn t make ryan believable they d just make him obnoxious  the problem with that is  who cares if a spoiled  whining  obnoxious jerk is dying  not me  br    br   the only thing this character has going for him is the fact that he s dying  and sorry  but that s just not enough  dying doesn t make anybody special  we re all dying  sooner or later  it doesn t give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk  br    br   the other two characters  and the actors playing them  david cubitt as theo and chandra west as sarah   are very much more interesting  and their story  without ryan s self pitying interruptions  would have made a much better movie  but it s not over yet  and it s time to hit play again  maybe something great happens before the end     br    br   nope  sorry  this rented turkey goes back tonight 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162677,if it wasn t for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this  documentary  i would never have seen this comedy  this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments  one in particular is where the afghan police   soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away  still filming  presumably to his plush hotel  then there s the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion  br    br   i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has  5 8   10   i thought imdb users had more sense 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116762,to say that thunderbirds is a horrid  forced  in your face  ugly looking  nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn t be saying enough  there are only two reasons i can think of why you d watch this film  1  you ve seen thunderbirds when you were young  like i did  and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up  or  2  you re seeing it with someone under ten years old  br    br   thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts  the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle  humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it  from the off  thunderbirds is wrong  wrong  wrong  the whole moral message and  goal  is set up in an excruciating way  jeff tracy  a new low for bill paxton  tells his youngest son alan he s not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island s bowels to fire up thunderbird one  the whole film is then a series of events and miss fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five  br    br   the film relies on kid actors to carry the film  a 16 year old alan tracy  corbet   a 16 year old tin tin  hudgens  and a 14 year old fermat  fulton  who is brains  son  to say that watching the  adventures  they get up to is painful is an understatement  frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil  hood   kingsley  in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film  it only differs when everyone s in a different location  also  the whole  mind control  thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood   forced and incidental  br    br   i know that most  film s for kids  these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it s done in a way that fetishises lady penelope  sophia myles plays penelope and i think it s no coincidence she s a little older than the rest of the kids   at 24 years old  it s almost too good to be true  her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push  we see her in the bath  bubbles up to her neck watching tv  in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet  bare and bubble covered foot  frequent shots of her massive  bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes  this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman  twinned with this  her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh  dominant  english accent  sounding like a commanding mistress  well  she is lady penelope after all   and you d better make sure call her that  the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won t notice but it sure as hell is there  br    br   the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre  the characters that are his bodyguards  a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot  are we supposed to be laughing at this  what about the fight scenes  poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises  it s utterly  utterly laughable  br    br   the list goes on  the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously  like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another  the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place  news bulletin  sponsored by ford  the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot  the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip   it s infuriating  the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing thames  against the current  rescue a downed monorail  monorail over the thames     get back to the hatch and thus  save the day all the time holding her breath  it is absolute bull and the makers know it   i don t even know if a 10 year old would swallow it  br    br   in short  avoid  avoid  avoid  thunderbirds is infuriating  unfunny  poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car   everything that could go wrong  did go wrong 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218817,and the oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to   dwight frye  seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff  lugosi  and price  and this movie proves it  his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie  dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie  br    br   the other reason is the comic relief of m  eburne  being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone hypochondriac  though other  medical mistakes  did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication     well continue giving it to her  unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie  the plot is predictable with only few minor twists  the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn   yes you can use too much shadow  br    br   my recommendation   watch this once to see frye and eburne   but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250,saw this  film  recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see  what the hell was going on with coolio  totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress  totally uninvolving  slow  tedious and detached  worse than spawn  long live  evil dead ii  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120861,i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered  br    br   why i didn t walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say  i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately   several people in our theater did and sadly i didn t follow them out  br    br   the story lacked all criteria for a movie  no plot  awful acting  even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in  not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk  i did like the tazer scene  too bad it didn t shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot  someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374569,that s what the title should be  anyway  br    br   this movie combines guns  explosives  and mindless killing to make one flop of an  action  movie  let me make my point in a series of questions  answers type deal  br    br   what happens in the movie  people die  br    br   is that it  yes  br    br   what is the plot about  what plot  br    br   what is the point the movie is trying to make  killing is the only solution  br    br   what are the characters like  extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities  br    br   is there anything good about this movie  yes  i m sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it  br    br   if you like constant killing and greed  then watch the movie  if you happen to be repulsed by such low standard  entertainment   then  made men  is not for you  br    br   to sum it up  the plotline stinks  the characters aren t worth their while  the storyline is completely resistable  and nothing fits together  br    br   this proves one thing  the actors  directors  and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren t  made  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267440,well it s not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community  the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in 1980  so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy  a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine  well la haine it is not  i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late  but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly  br    br   the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london  but i m concerned that film makers now use type casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging  saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all  but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence   tragedy
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469999,after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed   not because of the actors  story or directing   i was disappointed by this film advertisements  br    br   the trailers were suggesting that the battalion  have chosen the third way out  other than surrender or die  polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or german guns  they even translated the title wrong as  misplaced battalion    this have tickled the right spot and i bought the movie  br    br   the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies    then i began to think  hey  this story can t be that simple    i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops   well  he didn t  they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen  and so was i  br    br   the story was based on real events of world war i  so the writers couldn t make much use of their imagination  but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring  and as i wrote in the first place   it isn t fault of actors  writers or director   their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116890,as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don t like johnny test  now i think i know what people are going to say    how do you know how bad it is  have you ever watched it    i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn t hold a candle to my standards  br    br   i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen  like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation  i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount  br    br   so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show  it tries way too hard to be like dexter s lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female  there is a talking dog why    and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat  i have others but i don t think i can write them here   i don t mean cursing but i mean i don t know if there is a limit for words    everything else though is spot on  even a deedee character johnny himself  it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff  br    br   lastly i want to talk about the jokes  remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling  yes  yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter s lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke  johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50  of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears  that isn t comedy  thats stupid comedy  i know what some people are thinking  isn t three stooges stupid comedy  watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option    sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which  like chowder  makes me mad  i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together  to much bizarre doesn t equal comedy  it makes you just think  what am i watching    br    br   so it strikes out on all accounts  don t watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway  shape  or form 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0863080,well  i can and will be very short  this is a wrong balanced  non convincing film that could have been a little bit better  the script seems to not know which way to go     from funny to cliche wise serious    it s a bit silly  that plus too much sentences we have heard before  the hacker is in florida  or no  he is in madrid  no he is in       he is screwing the signal    br    br   4 out of 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078133,how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long haired ghost woman shtick  admittedly  they ve managed to rip off  ringu  a million times  and often it worked well   which just goes to show that originality isn t that much of a requirement in the horror genre  or that i m very uncritical and easy to please    however  this time around i found myself a little restless  somewhat bored  it s not a bad film  but it s at least half an hour longer than it should be  with its absurd 110 minutes length  compared to many other japanese horror films  omc lacks atmosphere and excitement  plus  the ending is confusing  it makes no sense at all  as for the ring tone  miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing  even though it was played a dozen times i can t even remember it   that s how scary it was  speaking of miike  for him this is something of a commercial venture  so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the  bijita q  or  audition  kind  they re wasting their time

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329334,one of the cornerstones of low budget cinema is taking a well known  classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it  phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule  the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late  80s shopping mall  however  the  phantom s  goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family  the special effects do provide a good chuckle  especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand  pauly shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect  mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived  if you re looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew  check this flick out  otherwise  keep on looking for something else

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892874,going into this i was expecting anything really good  but after the damage this inflexed on me  i m just happy to think strait  it s hard to think what the film makers  ha   this was a good movie  the stories  and i use the world loosely  are incoherent and do make any sense at all  there just stupid things that happen at random  the acting  if can be called acting is horrible i ve seen batter acting in toy ads  i know it s a low budget video bin garbages  but still even it s not like they tried  will after stetting thought it  i feel very sleepy and still  yawws  do  i m going to go lie down  br    br   warnning  do not atemp to drive  walk  read or do any after watching chillers  other side affectts may enguled lose of any or all metal funkions 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102585,i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  rocked   it is pure cg over acted crap  don t send an assassin  it s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored  aggressive  venomous snakes on a plane  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to  it is not  so bad it s good  it s so bad i d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again  i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane  a spoof  was i wrong  it s that whole  it sucks  get it   or samuel a  jackson yells  snakes on the plane  thing  well i m sorry  i don t get it  it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard  if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung s cd  still live in their mommies basement  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn  then rush to the theater and ask for one  since i doubt you have a girlfriend  ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane  to hell with movies like full metal jacket  pulp fiction  true romance  12 monkeys  clerks  etc  there s no irony in watching good movies  the true decline of the western civilization  calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man  or even orgazmo  i ve said enough here 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118868,i got the dvd from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production  i have to say  i was very disappointed  the subject had so much potential  the sets in a wagnerian production must  of necessity  be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience  instead  what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery  vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention  i found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas  i was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production   that did come across fairly well and next time i am at the opera i am sure i will remember that part if this video   but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291833,i like bad movies  i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration  then there are abhorrent movies like this  redline is not just a bad movie  but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please  for the sake of the viewer  at least proofread scripts before funding a movie  br    br   if a stereotype took a crap  this movie would spawn from that  the storyline is unbearable  and the acting all around is laughable  nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have  perhaps  the worst screen chemistry i ve seen in a good while  and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants  about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for   furthermore  how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can t even think of an analogy  i am a loyal fan of his  but this has made me question him  br    br   to sum it up  several people want revenge for different reasons  and if you care enough to know what they are  you re a bigger person than me   so much so that it turns to violence  i guess   the movie is like ouroboros  the snake that swallows its own tail  in that it s an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears  this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half  and an indecipherable action movie for the rest  it should be avoided at any and all costs  br    br   i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie  and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll  br    br   p s  nadia bjorlin  if that was you singing those two songs in this movie  then you are a hack  and i hope old age ravages you  br    br   p s s  if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience  listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin s awesome songs 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912,every year i watch hundreds of films  including many low budget amateurish straight to dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see  i have seen thousands of films in my time  many excellent  many forgettable  zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable  horror  films i have ever seen   in fact i still haven t recovered from the experience of watching it  br    br   the day after  it seems like some kind of weird dream  did i really see what i thought i saw  why do the police work out of a warehouse  did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the  zombies  eat cheeseburgers  is it safe  is it safe  is it safe   br    br   i wouldn t recommend zombie nation if you want to see a  good  film  and neither would i recommend it as  so bad its good   however  if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever   this is for you  now  whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is  i will say zombie nation  br    br   seriously   i think it s a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one  and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude  he really is the ed wood jr  of the digital age  and i for one can t wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120706,seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio  zombi  fulci might be up to his old tricks  unfortunately  other than the close ups of a rotting corpse  there s little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter s quest to figure out who killed him  none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it  that twist  at least  was cool   you stop caring  the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765447,forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2  so many 2s  game  like most video game turned movies  i would say the majority don t translate into a different medium really well  and that goes for this one too  painfully  br    br   there s a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story  and the mysterious island on which a writer  leo morimoto  and his children  daughter yuki  yui ichikawa  and son hideo  jun nishiyama  come to move into  the villagers don t look all too friendly  and soon enough  sound advice is given about the siren on the island  to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing  br    br   naturally and slowly  things start to go bump  and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants  but in truth  you will not bother with what s going on  as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more  what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity  until it s explained much later  it s one thing trying to come up and present something smart  but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered  br    br   despite it clocking in under 90 minutes   i think it s a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark   it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to  things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes  but it s a classic case of too little too late  br    br   what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end  again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience  it turned out rather satisfactorily  but leaves a bad aftertaste as you ll feel cheated somewhat  there are two ways a twist will make you feel   it either elevates the movie to a memorable level  or provides you with that hokey feeling  unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter  br    br   the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light  shadows and mirrors  but i will be that explicit   it s still not worth the time  so better to avoid this 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291082,this is possibly the worst fencing  sword fighting  movie ever made  that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot  characters are so weak that they ve got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and  later  supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying  i suppose to maintain audience interest  what a waste of f  murray abraham s talents  you re better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro  scaramouche  anything that has basil rathbone as the villain  as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film  but if it ever happens it s got to have fresher  better drawn characters and a plot with more depth

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244684,this film concerns purportedly non establishment types  aesthetically and sexually  who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs  although some excellent players take part  including jon tenney  timothy olyphant  and cynthia nixon  they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue  which isn t  nixon s role possesses the best lines  but she often homes in on them too quickly  a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director  the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche  spent or not  and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292429,this movie was a mess  it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen  it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial  and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream  br    br   under the messy direction and editing  there was a glimmer of something good  a good idea  a compelling spark  but somewhere it went wrong  br    br   the story is about a quasi psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders  the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest  well the part doesn t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well  the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy  he always plays the crazy bad guy  very ho hum  br    br   oh  a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy  horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character  grieco  was experiencing  and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords  not a good sign for any movie  br    br

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196267,what hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film  however  perhaps therein lies the problem  his movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within  but it s so impersonal  there are no characters  we never know who anyone is  thus there is no investment on our part  br    br   it could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters  is it  maybe  by that i don t mean that slipstream is ambiguous  i mean that there is no telling  hopkins s film is an experiment  on the face of it  one could make the case that it is about a would be screenwriter  who at the very moment of his meeting with fate  realizes that life is hit and miss  and or success is blind chance  as he is hurled into a  slipstream  of collisions between points in time  dreams  thoughts  and reality  nevertheless  it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion  even to the tiny  quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its characters  br    br   i didn t think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky  machine gun speed camera work and editing disengaged me  but reflecting upon the film i am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it  there are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmosphere deteriorating technical doodads  i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams  however  i knew barely anything about slipstream when watching it  and i came out the same way  and i just do not care  because hopkins made no effort to make us care  there are interactive movies  and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit  unaware of your presence  slipstream is the latter 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770810,when this movie was released  it spawned one of the all time great capsule movie reviews  sphinx stinks  it does  but in a mesmerizing sort of way  the casting is silly  starting at the top  frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians  not enough makeup in cairo for that  at least not while this film was being made  but it s rather amusing to see them try  the performances run the gamut from mummy like  sorry  the obvious observation  to over the top  with very few stops in between  the lesley anne down character seems as though she couldn t find egypt on a map  much less expound upon its archaeological treasures  that s due at least in part to some really bad writing  one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie  it s my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric  such as egyptology  are ripe for silly  overwritten dialogue  it doesn t disappoint  and the convergence proves a double whammy  the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension  can this get dumber and less believable  the answer is  usually  yes  the location shots are beautiful  and the set design is generally very good  the only consistent reminders that this wasn t some low budget production  that and the fact that there are so many well known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher  cheap  no  cheesy  yes

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0688816,this movie is truly boring  it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why  it s not because it s critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality  i would never want to pay money to watch this  i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china  it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself  the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there s plenty of them  the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad  i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film  the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good  i can t see any reason why people would like this  this is not an art film it s of waste of celluloid  that s if they actually shot it on film   which they didn t 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923293,remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn t quite meet those same feelings as an adult  that occurred to me when i went back to school  the national lampoon s class reunion  the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs  but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth  a man who appears to be a vampire  and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head  you have the class president who believes he s the best thing since sliced bread but as we see in the film  he s a coward and joke   a couple of pot smokers who don t even know they are at their own class reunion  and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed and no one can seem to remember his name  this is the one running joke i enjoyed   there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places  a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog  and the cook you know her from  goonies  and  throw mama from the train  who loves to place food on people s plates with her hands  the film is essentially about a nutcase who is or at least attempting to taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister    the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened  trashed hallways of the old high school  they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself  the film has a few good gags that work pretty much early on   but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute  the film s true problem is that it really doesn t know where to go  the film is pretty much a one joke premise for it has unassured direction  if it really has any direction at all  the cast is enthusiastic enough  but the material they are to make funny just doesn t have the quality to hold any interest  it s a curio for fans of early 80 s comedy relics that are forgotten this one rightfully so  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338130,people who actually liked problem child  1990  need to have their heads examined  who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny  the movie is not funny  ever  in any way  beginning to end  it wants to be a cartoon  but the writers don t realize that slapstick isn t funny when people get attacked by bears  or hit with baseball bats  it may be funny in cartoons  but not in a motion picture  br    br   the film s young hero is junior  michael oliver  who  since he was a baby  has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption  the families reject him  because junior tends to give them a hard time  br    br   he is then thrown into an orphanage  where he terrorizes the nuns  and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow tie killer  michael richards   he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy  the late john ritter and his wife  amy yasbeck   who are dying to have a child  in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood  br    br   junior becomes a member of the healy household  and  little  ben takes an interest in him  despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site  or throws a cat at his father  big  ben  jack warden   a bigoted politician  br    br   i think that we re supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people  his new mother  flo  is a bitch  his grandfather is completely selfish  and one little girl  who despises adopted kids  is such a spoiled brat  br    br   but what junior does to get the last laughs isn t funny   it s mean  cruel  and sometimes life threatening  br    br   and what is the film s message  that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism  that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers  they definitely don t what it s like to be a bad kid  junior isn t a one  he s just a sadistic  little twerp  there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others  now  everybody s laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat  br    br   it s a shame that this movie has been marketed as a  family comedy   what s worse is that problem child is rated pg  what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this  there s a lot of profanity and mean spirited pranks here  that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg 13  br    br   kids will enjoy this  but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen  and to most people  problem child will be considered a  guilty pleasure  classic  a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking  even though the prevailing opinion  as put forth by more serious viewers  is that the movie is a piece of crap 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317676,i usually don t write reviews but i can t understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers  br    br   i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so clich   it wasn t even funny any more  the same old stories you ve probably seen read a couple of times already   living toys  evil things from other dimensions    and it s not just that these stories aren t innovative  they are also pretty bad versions of those clich s  i d prefer e g   chucky  and  silent hill  over those two episodes anytime  and don t even ask about the visual effects    the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second    awful  looks like some film student s project gone wrong  blood    or gore    erm    nothing worth mentioning  br    br   it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn t seen read that many scary stories yet  although i d rather recommend  beyond belief    now that s what i call a decent mystery tv show   but for an adult horror fan this is worthless  i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography  especially in the second episode  and some nice acting 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097081,needless remake  and it can t come close to capturing the charm of the original  the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts  this version is ridiculously politically correct  the film lacks style  and mostly it lacks talent  not just with the acting  but the direction  sets  costumes etc  are all below par  it has a blatant disregard for period detail  vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair  tyne daly isn t too bad  they should have left well enough alone  the singing ranges good  vanessa williams  to poor  everyone else   watch the original 1963 version and skip this one  there is not much here to recommend 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887971,unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event  but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened  the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame  i get the impression ben coccio is an avid gamer   or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message  we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their cd s  talk about subtlety    but the movie only gets away with it because its  fiction   nice try  yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence  but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media  or video games  we dont  and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media  yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground  haha i somehow dont think so  br    br   the movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families  its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn t a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates  why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem  normal   when they are so obviously not  a completely false and phony depiction 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125510,three stooges   have rocket  will travel   1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad  it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze  from 1963  look like a masterpiece  br    br   the stooges are janitors at a rocket place  they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus  they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call  uni  which they bring back to earth with them   uni  speaks like an average  pleasant person    oh  hello  how are you  lovely planet here  hope you like it   hilarious  br    br   very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on  br    br   the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes  but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens  the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over  br    br   high point of the film   the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey  the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies  brutal  br    br   another writer mentioned the fine musical score  huh  the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes   i ll take romance and there goes that song again  both of which are played at the party  and  that  really is the high point of the picture   music from old columbia films  br    br   the tall sexy blonde was nice  br    br   awful   a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389957,i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sant s elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned  br    br   the story is about maddox   a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime   the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies   you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler   saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it s impossible to believe he could rally any disciples   the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama that s not worth going out of your way to see
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035096,i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one s heard of and could be a possible gem  i saw this and  since i m a fan of violence and gore  i got it  it got the rating of em which means  extremely mature  thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else  i got it  the warning on the box said  extreme violence  extreme langauge  and nudity  the  extreme violence  struck my fancy  the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick  it had one or two gory scenes but i ve seen worse in a pg 13 movie  of course the amount of gore in a movie isn t all that counts  right  you have plot also  well  the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it  don t rent it  i speak the truth  i can t imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say   i m gonna rent that again   it had it s moments where it kept you going but i m never going to see that film again

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081793,this movie is just truly awful  the eye candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie  br    br   the writer director producer lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage  family acceptance  religion  homophobia  hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times  but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes  br    br   the script is poor  the casting very ordinary  but the dialogue and acting is just woeful  the homo hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors  i think i ve seen more passion in an corn flakes ad   the acting is stiff  and the dialogue forced  a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight   br    br   i m just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution  and if he is thinking of doing so  i have some advise   just don t do it

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327409,i ve seen some very terrible horror movies in my time  and while this isn t the worst of the bunch  it s certainly in the lower half  the script starts off ok  a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern  hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife  cute huh  the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients  turns out that there s a demon on the basement that s harvesting people s souls  it s the job of the 1 doctor  1 nurse  and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs  do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out  and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects  at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid  i was begging for it to be over  there was still an hour to go  it looked like a half an hour  tales from the crypt  episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest  from tiny lister doing his best john coffey  the green mile  impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet  this movie fails in every possible level  i gave this 2 stars for only two reason  1  his fianc  is pretty hot  she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2  the movie actually looks ok  a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras  br    br   in the end  avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass  which i do  and i still felt cheated   as a bonus drinking game  you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi  dr  james bishop  shakes his head while talking  you ll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443489,i just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival  the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out  i m sorry to say i was very disappointed  br    br   besides being poorly written  it was boring  i won t take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script  br    br   first bite was clich  without being ironic  over the top seriousness without being funny  the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel  instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film  i can t recommend this film  it felt too long and all in all just plain weak 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198, the vampire bat  is definitely of interest  being one of the early genre setting horror films of the 1930 s  but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise  br    br   the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century  where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals  there is a very similar feel to james whale s  frankenstein  and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwill s dr niemann character  complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement  br    br   the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by having suspicion fall on bat loving village simpleton herman  dwight frye   thus providing the excuse for a torch wielding mob to go on the rampage   as if they needed one  br    br   this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co starred  also  doctor x  and  the mystery of the wax museum   and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements  taken in context though   the vampire bat  is still weak and derivative  br    br   all we are left with is a poor quality frankenstein imitation  with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans  but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the  blondie  films a few years later 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0888019,i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot  i m an open minded guy after all and i ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks  as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say  here goes   this film was mercifully short   that s all i got  br    br   okay  okay  the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits  i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd  br    br   by the time of the  chicken dance  at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall  i don t know what could have salvaged this film  the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn t any way to make it watchable  not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts  maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film  either way  i m not watching this film again unless i m really depressed  then i can tell myself  at least i wasn t in  dr  tarr s torture dungeon   i m better than those guys  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233501,it took 9 years to complete this film  i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said hey  this film is terrible  i ve seen better acting in porn movies  the story is tired and played  abused child turns into serial killer  how about something new for a change  how about abused child turns into a florist  at least that would have been a new twist  why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea  especially unoriginal movie ideas  thinks that they can be a director  i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed  that shows tenacity and spirit  with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script  if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from michigan see hatred of a minute  if you want a good movie from a michigan writer director stick with evil dead

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065761,you have to respect this movie  it may be  just a dumb kid s movie  but it s the  1 most frequently requested film title in online movie forums  requested by people who remember the story but can t remember the title  therefore what follows is a much needed  detailed plot description  since i haven t been able to find such a description anywhere else on the internet  br    br   a typical 2 story house is shown in suburbia  7 year old bridget narrates about suspecting something is going on since she and her 11 year old brother andrew are getting presents from their parents for no apparent reason  bridget s present is a stuffed penguin that she immediately names sweet william  bridget describes her relatives  aunt ruth  a bossy nurse taking care of grandmother  grams the hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks  and her brother andrew  who s into electronics and is grumpy  grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenant governor  which indicates she s getting in the way while living with the family  the two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving grams to a retirement home  bridget makes an awful looking pancake sandwich containing cereal  eggs  bacon  strawberries  and syrup  as andrew looks on incredulously  the two kids then discuss grams  and andrew says bluntly that grams is being  put out to pasture   bridget talks with grams in the attic  has a play tea party with sweet william in her bedroom  then a living doll unexpectedly pops out of her bedroom closet mirror  br    br   bridget and the living doll become acquainted  the curly haired living female doll is named huggins and lives in huggaland  bridget gives huggins a baseball cap from andrew s room  huggins hides under some laundry when bridget s mother comes by  then the mother throws the laundry into the washing machine with huggins in it  bridget rescues huggins and dries her off with a hair drier  they discuss the problem with grams getting old and having to move away  huggins says bridget could talk to the bookworm in huggaland about it  since he knows everything  they step through the mirror to visit huggaland  but one of bridget s tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror  br    br   rather than walk around with one shoe  bridget goes without shoes in huggaland  they immediately meet hugsy  a curly haired living boy doll in huggaland  huggins gives hugsy the baseball cap  they also meet tickles  bubbles  impkins  and tweaker  and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge  hugsy takes bridget and huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm  who lives atop a stack of giant books  the bookworm consults  the old encyclopedia  and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the  youngberry tree   however  only one such tree exists  and it s in the country of shrugs  ruled by the mad queen of quartz  the only way to travel to shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book  br    br   bridget and the two dolls gulp three times  jump down the hole  and tumble out  soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk  hear the sea of glass breaking  and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends  they encounter  the hairy behemoth   which looks like a mastodon  has four tusks  and breathes fire out its trunk  but hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth  who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is hodgepodge  hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen  and owes hugsy a favor  so they all ride on hodgepodge s back to the castle  they enter the castle  are surrounded by troll like beings  the queen  queen admira  comes  and bridget asks for a few youngberries  the queen refuses  then eats one for herself  and brags about her

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099,this movie bewilders me  it may be that i m just a stupid american  but i really just don t get 400 blows  everything i ve read about this movie has been a total rave  but i just couldn t stay interested  i m sure that it was as revolutionary in film making as all the critics say  but when it boils right down to it  it s just really really boring  maybe it s the language barrier  may i m just not  sensitive  or  artsy  enough  but whatever the case is  i hated this movie  the story itself isn t bad  it s about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers  and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility  that in itself ought to be interesting  and it was  at first  there was nothing wrong with the dialogue  but then again it s hard to say because half of the conversations weren t subtitled and for no apparent reason  so i didn t always know what was going on  but for the dialogue we could understand  it made enough sense  the actors were believable enough  but it s hard to say what a real person would do in these situations  so you feel for the main character  but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think  well that sucks  the plot isn t even your typical plot  each time he gets in trouble  he gets into more trouble than the last time  but the reasons never vary too much  and through the entire film you realize that there s nothing the main character can really do about it  so it s more like just waiting to see how it ends  the ending  by the way  was completely over my head  it s way too artsy for me  and i just didn t get it  leading up to the end was easy enough to follow  the structure was certainly there  and it made sense as well  but everything was really drawn out  for the amount of dialogue and significant moments  the movie could have been an hour shorter  it just didn t end  part of it was the unnecessarily long shots  none of which were especially memorable  for example  the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds  now  i m sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere  but for the average viewer  i d rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time  or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running  like doing my laundry  or taking a nap   br    br   final verdict  br    br   the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson  if i could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions  as it was  i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077668,this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious dvr hard drive space  i didn t expect much and i actually received less  not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode  i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again  i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter s hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse  i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the  07 fall schedual  perhaps a hospital crime mocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck  in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475937,the acting was bad  the script was bad and the ending was just terrible   the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up   but apart from that   this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001   why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it   why

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167183,well  at least my theater group did  lol  so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl  while it was never my favorite musical or story  it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it s still a lot of fun to watch  i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that s why i decided to never watch it  but my boyfriend said that it really wasn t all that bad and my friend agreed  so i decided to give it a shot  but i called them up and just laughed  first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn t really clever  not to mention they just used the same characters  but with different names and actors  tell me  how did the pink ladies and t birds continue years on after the former gangs left  not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy  gee  what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t birds were just stupid and ridiculous  br    br   another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn t stopped  but when a new student who is sandy s cousin comes into the scene  he is love struck by a pink lady  stephanie  but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t birds  so the new student  decides to train as a t bird to win her heart  so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t bird s butts  but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own  well  find out for yourself  br    br   grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn t work  the gang didn t click as well as the first grease did  not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable  because i thought that she graduated from rydell  but apparently she didn t  the songs were not really that catchy  i m glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast  but that s probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel  i wouldn t really recommend this film  other than if you are curious  but i warned you  this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical  br    br   2 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354690,i got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it  it had a 7 8 in imdb  9 votes only  and some external comments were pleasant  but i have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo  yes  great cinematography  the film is well directed  but it never freaked me out  it starts well  but although it not bored me at all  the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal  that i didn t like it very much  br    br   you can make a few laughs  and you can see some little tits  but if you like the kind of giallos i like  bizarre  surreal  nonsenseful  gory  atmospheric  brutal murders     you won t appreciate much this film  br    br   i give it a 4 for the good directing and editing  and the final twists  that make the film entertaining  but it could be much better

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369,this has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made  and yes  i was even shown the  end of evangelion  and that still made me hate it even more  not to mention the countless rip offs of this show  br    br   i don t mind psychological and philosophy untertones  but evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else  not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting  the only ones that seemed to be interesting were asuka  misato and pen pen  other than that  mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers  they need to go to a psyciatric center  not piloting giant robots against aliens called  angels   br    br   even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all  goes something like this  br    br    well  there are these robots  and they are really cool because they bleed    when they get hurt  but they are not really mecha  but captured angels  so sometimes they go insane and don t do what the underaged pilots want  and they have to be controlled better   blah blah blah   br    br   i am so sorry  but i just cannot recommend evangelion to anyone  anime otakus or not  to those who love this series greatly  fine you re entitled to that opinion  i respect you  but to thoses that have a  out of your mind  obsession to think that every one will like this series  you are more of an egotist  br    br   i prefer  macross    mospeada    run dim  and  robot taekwon v  myself 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078133,the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks  as mike sullivan  he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional  for him  role  hanks is usually the good guy in a movie   the one you like  admire and root for  sullivan was definitely not a good guy  it s true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble   his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son  even so  he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings  so hanks took a role i wouldn t have expected him in  and he pulled it off well  br    br   hanks  good performance aside  though  i certainly couldn t call this an enjoyable movie  after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic  it wasn t entirely clear to me for a while where this was going  it turns into a very sombre movie  about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster   largely raised by rooney  paul newman   who s a sort of mob boss  and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them  clean  so to speak  isolated from his business  after the older son witnesses a murder  the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet  gets the wrong son  and the mother   and leaves sullivan and his older son  mike  jr   on the run  it becomes a weird sort of father son bonding movie  br    br   although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note  at least in the overall context of the story  it s really very dark throughout  that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall  i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks  performance  the movie as a whole just didn t pull me in  4 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053241,i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday  intending to tune in to something else  out of curiosity  i accessed the comments here  and found myself watching it to the end  i really didn t do so with intent    this was one of those movies where you re  fascinated   and watch it for  another couple of minutes   until you finally just watch to the end  and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view  the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano  and their earlier roles  but great isn t anywhere to be found anywhere here   story  performances  and particularly the absurd courtroom hi jinks  we all know that perry mason  before raymond burr passed the 300 lb  mark   and ben matlock  are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom  instead of being boringly confined to a lectern  and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them  before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of  or shown  them  no real life judge or prosecutor would stand for this  br    br   both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer  actually perry nearly always did this  but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit  pronounce it  reasonable doubt   and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party   sometimes on camera  sometimes presumed at the end of the show  br    br   but that said  holland taylor s histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her  in the courtroom portion of this story  made the actions of matlock mason more closely resemble the slow  often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real life courtrooms  br    br   every character in this presentation was either insipid  unsympathetic  obnoxious  boring  improbable   or some combination of two or more of these  br    br   the ending was the most banal  absurd  even silly conclusion possible   but again  fascinating because of this  ladd and spano are attractive individuals  and t v  movies would appear their best forte   probably best in 2nd lead  probably better if  3rd    roles  even in this venue  taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them  give this one 1 star for the story performances  and 3 additional for the fascination factor 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108171,i can t believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end  and it did  the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer   so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird  no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did  and probably the worst prosecutor on earth  why was he in court anyway  he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty  a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings  but no go  he preferred to say  objection  2 or 3 times during the whole trial   that was it  the blonde lunatic was given a truth drug to prove her innocent but not brett  the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession  but again no go  during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head  even real weirdos do not look that silly fake  i am innocent  like she did  and what does this movie tell us  never marry a woman with a life insurance  as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail  guilty or not  evil  evil men 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183916,i don t know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business  this movie  short  is gross  to say the least   it is a bunch of 5 7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins  acting like adults  and too much so    however  it is interesting because it is a good example of how  the good old days  may not have been so good after all   thank god we have laws against this kind of material now   br    br    this is one short from the  shirley temple festival  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481280,as a fan of science fiction movies  i have been aware of the matrix since its release in 1999  from the little bit i would allow people to tell me about it  i assumed it was highly original and sophisticated  i am also a devotee of alice in wonderland  i could never quite figure out how i missed the matrix when it was released  with the imminent release of the matrix reloaded  it was time to buy the dvd and watch it  br    br   the disappointment was too great  the premise of the matrix  the controlling device as opposed to the movie  was clever  the philosophical premise of parallel worlds  alternate realities is shopworn  however  i could still have bought into the film  as science fiction  if it stayed firmly in that genre  unfortunately  it turned into a standard   will they or won t they escape  break through  rescue those in need of rescue  etc   to make matters worse  it turned out to be another martial arts exercise  the problem is that science fiction and martial arts films are really two different types  to the purest  the devotee of one or the other  mixing the two doesn t work  it is like mixing science fiction with romance  you can have one or the other  but not both in the same film  or  at least  not both to the same extent in the same movie  br    br   if there were such problems with the matrix  the matrix reloaded really compounded the problems  at least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car chase   this observation ignores the question  made in every professional  negative review of the movie  if neo could do the superman thing  why bother to fight at all  the answer  of course  is that s what draws the young  male demographic group into the theatre   then there is the  redemption through love  aspect  that plot device was worn out by richard wagner over a hundred years ago  it was actually handled better by him in die gotterdammerung  br    br   so where does that leave those who saw the matrix reloaded  martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite  but arcane sci fi philosophizing  science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung fun fest  most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film  br    br   just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see the matrix franchise films  science fiction  martial arts  or soap opera  a bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them  nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247804,this movie has richard pryor  rosey grier and others  it s a curious ww2 movie  and serves as a statement about racism  it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray  meaning this is a 70 s movie not a 40 s movie  ww2   still  there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam  the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company  there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about  the black lt  gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek  and the white capt becomes upset  i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106064,the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine  this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca  i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy  but let s look at the obsolete theme of the movie  br    br   with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom  since watch on the rhine  author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story  julia  from her book  pentimento   as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists  it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists  who had just proved their military superiority in spain  br    br   as one reviewer correctly noted  this is not a pro american play and movie  as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communist  this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then  just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219103,ok ok  it might be hard to put the entirety of a man s life in one film  traditionally therefore  biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject s life  now  byron was a  my week beats your year  fellow  which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder  furthermore  just as byron s poetry is inseparable from his life  the man s life itself must be seen as a whole  lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture  it s showing a different picture altogether  br    br   now  in short my review comes down to this  supposedly  byron was indeed the  my week beats your year  prototype  a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime  true  he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in   but in the end  this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we d all want to lead  no  well  i did not  at any moment  want to live the life depicted in this film  so it gets 3  not for being so badly done  which  direction wise  it more or less was   but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot  br    br   some more detail  well  to over simplify things  a byron bio should have two distinct episodes  1  post first europe trip  england and his rise to fame   marriage   2  his life abroad  now  the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first  not only was it a lot longer  but the most significant change in byron took place then  furthermore  it s where he created his best works  don juan  the vision of judgement etc    all the stuff that makes him  really  unique in english literature   br    br   instead  in this film  a  byron s life never comes across as even remotely entertaining   b  it only gets  worse  after he leaves england  they did two good jobs  first  they started at his return of his europe trip  though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue   second  they chose an angle  and they chose his incestuous love for augusta  who is rather perfectly cast   the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go  true  byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life  but  especially as he was such a mood swing person  the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life  br    br   anyway  the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england  there s no doubt about that  the thing is  once abroad  a life of debauchery began  with the infamous geneva period   but in italy byron also discovered a new life  both for his poetry  inspired by italian comedy   already in venice  and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna  afterwards  at the request of shelly  with teresa  to pisa   in other words  he was also  liberated   his mind and life opened up  and not only in the decadent sense   while england s closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age  true  freedom was augusta less  but this bitter sweet freedom tastes sour in this film  we see a lonely  bored snob getting older  br    br   i mean  hell  byron never thought much about his poetry  except when he finally found his own voice in don juan  apart from poetic and romantic developments  his relationship with shelly  and the down break  should have been more documented  also  it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas  this is important  as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted in life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan  life and work are one  true  still a bit naive  but it s what got him to greece  and the whole thing came full circle in pisa  where shelley s revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark  missolonghi wasn t the bored snob suddenly looking for some action  it was the insights in italy  the gambas  stirring him into action  it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism  but it wasn t just that  there was a true inspiration behind it  meanwhile  byron wrote massive amounts of don juan  true  his end is a bit sad  but it s not like he s worn out  that is the essence of byron s life  he may have had some strong emotional attachments  2  augusta and teresa   but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly  meaning that he wasn t  less  at the end of his life   no  he d made a physical and mental journey that  at the time  few people were prepared to make  br    br   i wonder  why is it that so often the second period in byron s life is overlooked  because it had less obvious conflicts  as the man was finally coming to his own  in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals  we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time  which byron so despised  and which  despite the fact that he had no choice  he  willingly  fled in 1816  to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089326,when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb s views on a film and  until this one  had never seen a flick rated 7 0 or above on the site i did not enjoy  br    br   sidney lumet  a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century  really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can  filling a film s cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever  br    br   i like films with flawed characters  but no matter how dark someone s personality is we all have a bit of light in there too  we re all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others  mr  lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch black characters  br    br   ethan hawke s hank is a 30 something whining  immature  irresponsible man child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he s a loser  which he very much is  his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he s too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed  by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film  it s more pathetic than uplifting  ethan hawke plays his character well  but isn t given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn t  particularly care that it s there  br    br   speaking of which his character s wife is equally as bad  just about every single shot of the film she s in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non existent self esteem with insults  seriously  that s just about all the character does  her harpy like behavior borders on malevolent  br    br   albert finney plays their father charles  and while mr  finney has been a great actor for many decades  he spends about 90  of this film with the same mouth open half grimace on his face like he s suffering from the world s worst bout of constipation  for someone who s been an actor as long as mr  finney  you think he d be more apt at emoting  even though he doesn t show it much  his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger filled  and when he smothers andy at the film s conclusion it s akin to dr  frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it s own misery  br    br   marisa tomei isn t given much to do with her character  stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason  when andy s world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship  but it really doesn t make her any less selfish or self serving than any other character in the film  but probably the one with the most common sense at least  br    br   and finally we come to andy  played by the always good philip seymour hoffman  is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1  his performance of the heroin addicted  embezzling financial executive who s  perfect crime  of robbing his parent s insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing  his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable  deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic  hoffman s character ends up being the film s chief villain  but it s hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who s self admitted poor early parenting led to his son s eventual psychosis and indirect  unintentional murder of his mother  br    br   ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh s great performance and it s family train wreck nature  just don t expect there to be any characters worth cheering for  because there really aren t 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427038,oh man  does this movie ever bite  if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre  done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time  pc friendly  means no nudity  a classic element of slasher films  cut is it  every cliche is retread without a hint of self awareness and the acting  oh  the acting redefines the word horror  i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309395,the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the  hope  to see something interesting  the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really  really bad  honestly  i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad  br    br   the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was   she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director     surprise  surprise  next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife  awful story and terrible performance 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096117,this movie is just plain dumb  br    br   from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax  the film is an exercise in wooden predictability  br    br   mike hammer is one of detective fiction s true sociopaths  unlike marlow and spade  who put pieces together to solve the mystery  hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth  this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are     well  too dumb to get away with anything  one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack  br    br   other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book  velda s dance at the barre  for instance  or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back  and the continuity breaks are shameful  frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she s way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot  the worst break  however  precedes the popcorn attack  the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero  except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy  br    br   to be fair  there were some interesting camera angles and lighting  and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen  which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062159,much has been written about purple rain  the apparent  quin essential  musician bio movie  however i m here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it s high praise  br    br   first of all let s get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels  even the score is mesmerising  and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it s not and as such the movie has some problems  br    br   first of all is the horrendous acting writing  prince s character  the kid  is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere  a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments  unfortunately prince s character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it s hard to believe that he d get the girl this way  everything just seems a little off here  which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that s terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live  but we aren t ever allowed to get inside of it  br    br   a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert  prince and morris s lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here  which i guess makes sense from a business perspective  but it s exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage  especially when the character s back stories get pushed aside for it  br    br   so to sum it up  this isn t a very good movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245115,i think this film has been somewhat overrated here  there are some things to admire in it  for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction ish  film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day  the supporting cast is good  the set design and cinematography are good  and the ideas are interesting enough  though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre dark city   memento   fight club clones of recent years   but the film is undone by poor characterization  wooden performances from the lead actors  and a laughably bad ending  br    br   the main problem i had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable  i realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a  wait for it     cipher  but i was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring  anonymous schlub of a man  what character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot  lead actor jeremy northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless  but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him  opposite him  lucy liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own  unless being the embodiment of a spy movie clich  counts as personality  br    br   one of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending  i won t give any spoilers here  but i will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred  further  after being content to be a quirky  idea oriented movie for the first hour or so  the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of hollywood pap  complete with big explosions and special effects  the revealing of the film s mcguffin at the end is poorly done  and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film s main plot threads were resolved  br    br   the movie s not all bad  though  it does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it  despite the slow pacing  although i think i have a higher than average tolerance for slow paced movies   and there are some moments when the unsettled  paranoiac feeling that director vincenzo natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface  but in the end  these elements aren t enough to overcome the flaws in the film s acting and script  there is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas  but this isn t it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171363,being a music student myself  i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch  little did i know     i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears  this movie was implausible throughout  it s obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn t know a thing about classical music  let me give you just a few examples  1  there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever  just having a nice pop voice isn t enough  besides  that s a different thing altogether   another genre  different technique  it s like playing the violin when applying for a viola class  2  how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury  if she wasn t a singing professor herself  she would have no say in a situation like that  and if she was a singing professor  why weren t we told so  3  being able to read music is a necessity if you re to major in music  4  how did angela get a hold of that video tape  that would have been kept confidential  for the jury s eyes only  now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn t have a clue  i wonder which    5  the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she  had the range   which she clearly did not  yes  she was able to sing the notes  but carmen is a mezzo soprano  while holly s voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre  not at all compatible with that song  6  worst of all  not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music  but it doesn t even try to hide it  the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition  a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital  where it is cut short in a disgraceful way   mozart would roll over in his grave  the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times  too  and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music   it s stiff and boring but hey  add some drums and electric guitars and it s almost as good as britney spears  i know these are all minor details  but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research  anyhow  i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated  but without that  i really can t find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one  it s good for a laugh 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273656,the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds  and looks more like caricatures rather than characters  i ve been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969  i didn t think much of the scooby doo animated movies   i m talking about the tv series  not the full length movies    but some of them were pretty cool  and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant  but this series is pure garbage  as soon as i saw the animation  and heard the characters   and i use that term loosely  speak  i cringed  also  mystery inc   was a team  and without the entire crew to compliment each other  it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones  and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants  what s new scooby doo was better than this  if you re going to have a scooby doo tv series  include the elements that made the series endure so long  the entire cast of characters  and quality animation  they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026273,i think i laughed twice  the line where the main character says something about being from the streets  and then i forget the other time i laughed  it was probably in the beginning  br    br   this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever  doesn t hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad  really  you can only insult yourself so many times  br    br   2 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427688,not a knock on korman as he was very funny on the carol burnett show  he was also good at playing secondary characters in mel brooks  movies   high anxiety  comes to mind   he is  however  not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less  this one is basically a  gremlins  knockoff  following a tradition of such movies as  critters  and  ghoulies   it is not a very good knockoff either  on par with  ghoulies   but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got  in fact  this one is too light and frothy  and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat  though i did give it a 3 for a score  this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse  gremlin  knockoff  if you watched mystery science theater 3000 you know the one i am talking about   the infamous  hobgoblins   this one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place  i only saw this movie once a long time ago so i don t remember everything to clearly  and it starts out friendly enough  however  this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie  more misses than hits in the joke department  and it is also really lame to see korman playing the evil brother role  best to skip this one  but then you may want to check it out just for kicks

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117445,having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about  unfortunately  a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen  samurai  the geisha world of kyoto originate from  some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings the geisha dances were not authentic  there was far too much use of chinese music  a minor but essential detail  proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen  the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy   interestingly  some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492754,i just did not enjoy this film  but then i loved babe  a pig in the city and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way  the animals were not likeable  they were all irritating especially chris rock s guinea pig  but then what could i expect  it s chris rock  i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines  but that s it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254686,i really wanted to like this film  but the story is ridicules  i don t want to spoil this film    don t worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen   but here s an example of how sloppy this film was put together  the cowboy and  twig  ride up the ridge  the cowboy has a handle bar mustache  the cowboy and  twig  get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge  the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film  sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave  in dark  on the back of a horse  br    br   to be fair  the acting by the four main characters is solid 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080596,i don t know what they were thinking by they i mean anybody even remotely connected to this disaster i ve seen so bad movies i ve seen so really bad movies and then there s this but i will say one thing whoever wrote the script has manged to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over written onto the screen there is nothing good about this movie either from a technical standpoint or any other standpoint whoever allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately there are a few fairly well known names in this movie actually i hesitate to use the word movie it s more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense anyway i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this i got it really cheap and i still got ripped of even if i had gotten this movie for free i would still have been ripped off this is an absoluter 0 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360813,i hadn t heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website  which made me curious  as a cartoonist and illustrator myself  i m an admirer of richard williams s work   i rate ziggy s gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time  and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen  i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work  care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals   but it seems the man has his faults  most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule  and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super talented individual like williams can go  given the right circumstances  br    br   raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children s cartoon  it tries also to be a musical  it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well   is it a freakout  is it a mind blower  is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination    until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations  it s beautifully animated  for the most part  though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention  but even that doesn t count for much when you re confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the  action  here  br    br   there are a number of problems with the film  but let s start with raggedy ann and andy themselves  they re the stars of the show  yet they have no personalities  actually  we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy   i m no girl s toy   he sings  and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner  a little girl called marcella  carries her upside down  but that s all we get to find out about these dull as mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after  i use the word  weirdness  advisedly  because some weird films can be hugely entertaining  but this is just flat out strange  the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable  but they re actually bizarre and disturbing  the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this  but even they re relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain  whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll  yes  this is supposed to be a children s film  then there s the music  none of which is memorable  and all of which is sung by actors who can t sing  and to add insult to injury  there s a lot of singing in this film  when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom  the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are  about how they ll always have each other and   yes  we get the message  this seems to go on forever  but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film  not for long  though  because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it s made from worn and faded denim  and   bad enough that he s clearly a paranoid schizophrenic   he also starts hallucinating  but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow  the greedy  a living  breathing  belching  farting  constantly eating pool of taffy  is so trippy  creepy and ultimately disturbing  you ll hardly believe what you re seeing   this is as close to a drug free psychedelic experience as i ve ever seen on film  then  after a l o n g time spent with the greedy  along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo  whose throne resembles a urinal  i can t believe i m actually writing a capsule description of a real film here   i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i m not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked out nightmare i had  part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay   little nemo cartoons  for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it  probably  all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it  but there isn t  these scenes are just strange  and very  very long  surrealism only works when there s a strong idea behind it  or takes place against some semblance of reality  but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality  take away this element  and you re left with pure self indulgence  br    br   as the final scenes unravel  even the animation begins to look less impressive  the pirate ship  ludicrously detailed  jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production  and there s a non event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out  even at a meagre 86 minutes in length  the film feels like a never ending ordeal  and it s understandable why it flopped on its original release  animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly  but he did  and there s nothing anyone can do about it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425638,to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this  its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close up  followed by another two and half minute freeze frame of ms  streisand    striking a christ like pose    behind the closing credits  over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbra s distinctive visage dead center  filling the big screen with uncompromising ego  that just might be some sort of cinematic record  br    br   or think about this  the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars  yet  while streisand s songs are performed in their entirety    including the interminable finale    her costar kris kristofferson isn t allowed to complete even one single song he performs  nor  though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties  do they actually sing a duet  br    br   or consider this  streisand s name appears in the credits at least six times  including taking credit for  musical concepts  and her wardrobe  from her closet     and she also allegedly wanted  but failed to get co directing credit as well  one of her credits was as executive producer  with a producer credit going to her then boyfriend and former hairdresser  jon peters  as such  streisand controlled the final cut of the film  which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction  what it doesn t explain is how come  given every opportunity to make the great diva look good  their efforts only make streisand look bad  even though this was one of streisand s greatest box office hits  it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance  br    br   anyway  moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex drugs and rock n roll  streisand plays esther hoffman  a pop singer on the road to stardom  who shares the fast lane for a while with kristofferson s john norman howard  a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to has beenville  in the previous incarnations of the story   norman maine  sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer  vicky lester  achieve her success  in the feminist seventies  streisand   co  want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man  so the trajectory is skewed  she ll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one  he s a burden she must endure in the name of love  as such  there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher  but almost ruthless  while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit  br    br   kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material  making little attempt to give much of a performance  and oddly it serves his aimless  listless character well  streisand  on the other hand  exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen  everything she does seems  if not too rehearsed  at least too controlled  even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical  the two have no chemistry  making the central love affair totally unbelievable  you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence  though at age 34  streisand doesn t seem particularly young or naive  the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom  and  indeed  had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way  to make streisand s character openly play an exploitive villain  the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist  br    br   but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim  they don t seem to be aware just how cold blooded and self absorbed she is  but sensitivity is not one of the film s strong points  note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos  and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman  yet the filmmakers have changed the character s name of the previous films from  esther blodgett  so that streisand won t be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive  so much for ethnic pride  br    br   the backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film s release is near legendary  so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable  nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie  with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees  and the film did serve its purpose  producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes  including the oscar winning  evergreen  by paul williams and streisand   but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didn t want it to be  a vanity project 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102210,i didn t enjoy this movie at all for one i just found it crude and vulgar for no reason i also felt it s misogynistic against women  also the movie really doesn t appear to be about anything and i didn t find any of the characters likable really the there doesn t seem to be any point to it all maybe i m missing something but for me this movie is pretty much a waste of time when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable like using my face as a pin cushion james garner is in this thing as are c thomas howell and shirley jones and james cromwell all are wasted here and i m sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers jennilee harrison from the later years of three s company is also in the movie and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role but other than that she can t rise above the mediocre script for me tank is a 3 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079573,the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won t do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style  ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too  hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing  all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time  this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show  it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177876,i had always been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movie i had to see it i was bitterly disappointed this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn t wear the right costume  she must have refused to or had ordered major changes  and the plot runs like a poor man s james bond there s none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e  the superhuman strength or determined will it s just one long bad dream i don t even think cathy is all that attractive anyway i wouldn t waste your time on this 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837786,this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year  you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here  there are spoilers  gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin  heather graham and tom cavanagh   only gray and sam are brother and sister  living together in everyone else s eyes as man and wife  no sex but just about everything else  early on  the movie starts with its theme   the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions   gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch  rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him  she does it and gets to the nitty gritty questions too  when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3 way date  charlie  bridget moynahan  is the girl of their dreams  like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal  that charlie accepts  in one week charlie  gray and sam are to be in vegas  in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns  apparently charlie has an off the rack figure   gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a  10 000 frock for her  while charlie is zipping her in this  down payment on a house  gown gray continues to slurp on the latte  i swear it was like a feed bag   what should happen but  woops   latte all over the gown  it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale s bridal salon with out a  10 000 mocha colored gown  back to  reality    caesar s palace las vegas  they have the  high roller room   sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist   were do they get all this money   gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink a thon were  you guessed it   they kiss  gray remembers everything  charlie remembers nada  they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line  if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds  gray gets the hiccups  gray excuses herself  for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again  hiccups   gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets  literally  and of course one is you guessed it again  gay  the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver  alan cummings  named gordy  he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned  they become great friends  this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss  he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment  when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office  gray works at an ad agency  this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone  it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency  sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office  this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew  gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar   sorry no men  says the bouncer  so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag  bad drag  he was in a sleeveless black satin like blouse  a string of pearls  and a grandma s church hat  no lesbian would ever confuse this  man in a dress  as a drag queen much less a woman  the bar was also the straight man s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is  full of victoria s secret models  everything turns out peachy   she goes home with her firm s client  gray happens to be on the woman s account and finally does more then kiss  for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray  but that is for the sequel

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369946,as usual  on imdb  going by the majority vote instead of the  weighted average  is far more indicative of the movie s entertainment value  in this case  the majority gives it a  one   how right they are  to start my review  i ll first admit that i am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled  alien intruder   it does involve space and even an  alien   i suppose   but there s no rhyme or reason  at all  for anything in the long run  at least  no actual plot basis or resolution that i can make out anywhere  br    br   there are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious  with regard to both the lines  the timing  and how they are spoken   that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies  i have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic bugs bunny seems to be ranting about something  br    br   the  plot  solely involves an area of space known as the g spot  sorry  make that g sector   and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien    virus  i think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal ariel appears as a photographic negative  br    br   for most of the movie  we see people getting shot with space weapons  falling out of lofts  and seemingly endless  pointless close shots of  where s ariel     can t find ariel   pointless because most of the other shots include interaction with ariel  anyway   whatever  on a computer monitor  commander skyler  billy dee   sits and watches each fantasy of the convict s vr programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it       or maybe i missed something    br    br   billy dee williams took a few courses on  how to act in despair  prior to the filming of this  we know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful  br    br   the docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi hilarious at least  and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle  looking much like a lego experiment gone awry  br    br   it seems everyone dies in this movie  so why bother  even the vr females get killed  as if that is supposed to mean anything  especially since everyone else dies anyway    outrageous  br    br   because of the money i save on groceries  i won t rant about wanting my money back that i paid for the dvd of this  the dollar that i saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer s time  br    br   i ll just add that the story itself  at least as a novel  and with far more detail added  could probably be quite interesting with the right author  br    br   1 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974629,wow  why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film  half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be  hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be  it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain  spoiler  the whole movie is this  twitch played by kurupt of tha dogg pound  gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried  in the jail  a riot breaks out between rival inmates  one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape  during a conjugal visit  twitch s fianc e and burke s played by bill goldberg daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room  burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones  br    br   opinion  this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier  the return  the script is terrible  the acting is horrendous  the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature  look  i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do  nobody in this  movie  believes in the characters they play  nobody in this  movie can be taken seriously as an actor  kurupt should be ashamed of himself  his character  twitch  is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates  bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd pretty huge dump   the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening  don t let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent  it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075921,i d been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much  i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn t work for me  br    br   the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn t really seem to understand which genre it s falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama  horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it s a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none  br    br   the premise  as with most revenge films  is simple  couple meet and go out  something bad happens and they get their revenge it s a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years  unfotunately in this case it s as if dan reed thought   it d be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail      wrong  there are also a few key elements missing  in this type of movie there s generally some kind of warning  a don t do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there s nothing of the sort here  it just simply happens  then nothing happens for an hour  then something interesting happens and then it ends  br    br   there s a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying  i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing    i d say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he s making instead of trying to be too clever and he ll have a quality movie on his hands

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087402,watching beautiful women sneaking around  playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy  so the house on carroll street was not entirely a waste of time  although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating  br    br   there are many allusions to different hitchcock pictures  not least the choice of kelly mcgillis in the starring role  she is dressed up as grace kelly  and she is not far off the mark  not at all  but her character is not convincing  the way she is introduced to the audience  she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life  after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period  true events and a specific issue  but the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run off the mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences  high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters  this is all the more regrettable  as the performances of the actors are good  as are the photography and the set design  br    br   the finale in central station  new york is breath taking  it starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof  the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493327,this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing  just because you ve got an excellent ensemble cast doesn t mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp  think about it  the film featured richard widmark  lauren bacall  charles boyer  gloria graham  lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film  the basic premise of the film isn t bad  a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients  also  the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife  widmark and graham  had a lot of promise  however  the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo  with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film  in fact  it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of  general hospital   subtle  this film ain t   realistic  this film ain t    br    br   while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script  but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors  for example  paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent  especially when playing gangsters in film noir movies  yet here  stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accent  it just didn t work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one dimensional  also  charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place  seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarre  br    br   overall  this is a rather awful film  it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn t very pretty  my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent  br    br   ps  in a case of art imitating life  oscar levant played one of the patients  in real life  the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076191,this is a horrid disaster of a film  from beginning to end  it s filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing  the only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by streisand  because the kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to  the main problem of this film is that we never see kristofferson s character at his peak or streisand s character struggling  the first should be seen in decline and the second rising  the final streisand number  could have been  one of the greatest finales in film  if it was directed and edited properly  the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake  had the band  audience and wide shots of the stage been shown  this number could have been dynamic and interesting  this film must have been directed and edited by an nyu film school dropout  the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay  the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film  and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101764,this is one of the worst b slashers i ve ever seen in my life  the ending is something you have to see to believe  br    br   the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a santa suit  he puts the presents under the tree  eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney  phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother  then  harry goes up stairs  smashes a snow globe  grabs a shard of glass  and cuts himself  br    br   then you move on to the present  you see harry  he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars  he has two books  one book for good kids and the other for bad kids  he writes down everything they do in these books  the guy is a creep  he also works at the jolly dream toy factory  his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house  br    br   when harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits  he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids  then  he travels to a church and kills 4 people  then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree  the kids catch him but they go back to bed  so  harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves  br    br   as he is walking towards a house  a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him  the parent s are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don t get hurt  how do they know that harry is the killer  sure  you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be  harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids  br    br   when harry runs off  the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him  they don t even know that he is the killer  when harry reaches his brother s house  his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip strangles him  he only loses consciousness  phillip loads harry back into his van  when harry wakes up  he takes off  br    br   the ending is something i could not believe  once again  you ll have to see it to believe it  br    br   one thing that bugged me was the black santa  that s right  the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man  so why did they bring in a black man  br    br   skip this and see silent night deadly night and santa s slay  you ll get your money s worth seeing those two films  they are better than this pile of garbage  i give this movie 1 star out of 10  wish i could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460912,if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins  then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies  these barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies  which involve basically groteque characters  sex dreams   oh joy   but what that has to do with anything is anybody s guess  except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica  they show this down in the 8th circle of hell  one suspects  there s no real plot   just  goblins   kill   and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402755,i firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a  spoof   crispin glover is very serious about his film  he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago  he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy   what is it   is crispin glover s attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by herzog  lynch etc  br    br   i had heard rumor of this film years ago  epic porno movie with all down syndrome cast directed by crispin glover   when it finally came out i watched the trailer on line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation     i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment  if he took out the goofy sh t  such as the pot smoking grandma  and the dancing dolls  he would be left with something much better  but only about 10 minutes long  br    br   in other words just watch the trailer  be entertained  and leave it at that  there are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases  but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216196,i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed  br    br   heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours  or however long it actually was   from the beginning  every single element of this movie is unbelievable  this movie made me chuckle several times  but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together  br    br   the movie s focus is gray  graham  and her issues with intimacy  things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common  br    br   interesting  intriguing  however  instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable  the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all  being an lgbt individual  this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming out process   i ll be insulted if the writer s queer   had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham  which  by the way  was understandably forced   i would give it a negative 3 stars

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117603,a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle  they demand a huge ransom for her release  peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl  peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack  they try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter  the helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that  not going well so far   also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts  in reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem  he starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives  the rest of the film is a bit of a blur really  br    br   now i m not a massive jess franco fan  in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen  but even i can tell that this really isn t one of his best efforts  the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening  the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show  there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out  br    br   devil hunter is poorly lit  infact i don t think it was lit at all   badly dubbed  poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn t bore me  i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it  for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting  another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed  hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes  then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him  it has to be seen to be believed  then of course there is the actual devil  it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes  he has very blurry vision  br    br   the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80 s here in the uk and was banned  now why it was i have no idea  there is very little gore at all and it s hardly a shocking film  minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost  the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth  br    br   there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan  there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle  it would probably be more fun  br    br   3 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366292,this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget  dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid  chase scenes are uniformly boring  and most of the on screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film s last five minutes  a briefly glimpsed port a potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film s chief villain  no prop is here without a purpose   the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman s studio when he d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera  but without the discipline corman would impose 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125510,though i d heard that  cama de gato  was the worst brazilian movie of the decade  i watched it giving it a chance  after all  first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature  shot in video  for just us  4 000 and    though it looks even cheaper    i can t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it  then as i watched it i realized why   but whatever chances you re ready to give to  cama de gato   they shrink to zero within 10 minutes  it s an unbelievably preposterous  verbose  ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex  drugs and violence  and they re made to look like closeted gays too   made with no visible trace of talent  imagination  expertise or notion of structure  visually and aurally  it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube    only here it lasts ninety two  count em  minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness  and it s not even funny bad  br    br   we ve all seen the story before  bored young guys want to have fun  go partying  take drugs and everything goes wrong    there s gang rape  spanking  murder  the accidental death  falling down the staircase    of the mother of one of the boys  culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill  moral and literal garbage  get it  the film is heavily influenced by larry clark  especially  kids  and  bully    but clark s films    though also moralist and sexploitative    are high class masterworks compared to this crap  br    br   i don t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience s throat  stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion    you do get numb minded with so much babbling  yelling  inept direction  shaky camera and terrible acting going on  stockler doesn t care a bit about technique  the quality of the images  framing  sound recording  soundtrack songs  dialog  sets  editing  etc is uniformly appalling   but he s a narcissistic control freak  he anticipates the criticisms he s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments  and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is  i could relate to that    br    br   despite his megalomaniac ambitions  stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure    he can t even decide if he wants gritty realism  hand held video camera etc  or stylization  repetition of scenes  use of alternate takes  etc   damn  he can t even decide where to put his camera  there s use of subjective camera for the three leads   the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever  the plot exists simply to justify the director s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for  all you see is a filmmaker being hateful  preachy  condemning  moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent  or technique  to go with it  br    br   it s very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess  certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil  with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo s  blat can be highly effective under good direction  as in  carandiru    lavoura arcaica    proibido proibir    here  he s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped  actors  in recent memory  he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes  so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn   br    br   the film opens and ends with real interviews with  typical      middle class youth    stockler wants us to take those interviews as  proof  of what he s trying to preach in fiction  but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees  selecting a highlight of abject  racist  sexist  stupid statements  which only shows assholes exist everywhere   stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they re middle class and enjoy recreational drugs  is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs   or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior   i couldn t tell    br    br   with its dogmatic self righteousness  headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom   cama de gato  is bad for a 1 000 reasons but  above all  it s harmful in a very insidious manner  it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument   cama de gato  is best unwatched  unmentioned  buried and forgotten 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326820,zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead  while trying to escape the man is shot at   the metal container holding the chemical is breached  the man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie  within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims  kenny  deran sarafian    his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help patricia  beatrice ring    her friend lia  deborah bergammi  who has been pecked by zombie birds      general morton is in charge of the situation   has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world  but will he   his men succeed  br    br   this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke   therefore couldn t finish the film so producer franco gaudenzi asked second unit director bruno mattei   writer claudio fragasso to step in   complete the film  apparently mattei   fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage fulci shot   added a lot of their own   zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50 50 split  the script by fragasso is an absolute mess  none of it is well thought out   is just as stupid as it gets  the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd  the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever  look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge   the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it s on steroids  then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft  there are so many things wrong with zombi 3  scene after scene of terribly thought out   ineptly directed action  awful character s   really dull broken english dialogue which doesn t make sense half the time  then there s the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air   bite someones neck  the scene when the guy s in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny   roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try   kill them by hand  even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles   when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles   it s one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film   then there s the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but can t rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up   then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass  what  since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass  this all may sound  fun  but believe me it s not  it s a really bad film that is just boring  repetitive   simply doesn t work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs  br    br   it s hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot  it has a bland lifeless feel about it   for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist  the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine   you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine   thinning out as it disperses across the scene  since a lot of it is set during the day it doesn t add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever   when they do get it right   the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day  the direction is poor with no consistency   it just looks   feels bottom of the barrel stuff  even the blood   gore isn t up to much  there s a gory hand severing at the start  a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman s stomach  a legless woman  what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way   why didn t it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her     a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets  for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70 s   early 80 s will be very disappointed  there aren t any decent feeding scenes  no intestines  no stand out  head shots    very little gore at all  br    br   technically the film is poor  the special effects are cheap looking  the cinematography is dull  the music is terrible  the locations are bland   it has rock bottom production values  this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum  the entire film is obviously dubbed  the acting still looks awful though   the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesn t understand the language that well  br    br   zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci s classic zombie gore fest zombi 2  1979   it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash in title  i m sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film  it s boring  it makes no sense  it s not funny enough to be entertaining   it lacks any decent gore  one to avoid

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104549,ok  as everyone has pointed out  this film is a complete dog  to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised  or darkened down to near invisibility  to escape the censor s x rating  but the film has many other flaws as well  br    br   to begin with  the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up  the baddies in this film are furry and don t like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires  now you just can t do that with a crappy genre flick  you ve got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing  in fact the whole  confusing and poorly presented  plot is something that has already been done for vampires  but doesn t make any sense in a werewolf movie  br    br   secondly  the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen  anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically  yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy  br    br   there are a couple of slightly good bits  i actually quite liked the score  others have mentioned sybil danning s tits  and    br    br       spoiler     if such a thing can exist  br    br   i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves  stronghold  there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly  but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters  i mean  you can kill werewolves with silver bullets  and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days  shouldn t be too hard to put two and two together  hmm  but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti lycanthrope weapons 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195234,this movie is god awful  not one quality to this movie  you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad  the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i ve ever seen  this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably  if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead  if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies  please avoid this movie at all costs  it is unwatchable and pointless  you ve been warned  i ve got nothing else to say about this stupid movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118643,this sleek  sexy movie is a must see  only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film  personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent  no subject left untouched  style of narration  the introduction grips you right away  and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film  he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really  connect  with internal horror this film exhibits  the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully  not only for kids  but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience  ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography  it surely defines the word  masterpiece

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473553,boy this movie had me fooled  i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever  boy i got the cold shoulder that time  this movie was  and i m truthful  pretty damn good  it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting  some to the horrible acting and clich  killings were so painful to watch  i almost laughed at how bad it was  but to some extent i enjoyed it  the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas  which made things more intriguing  the pov camera angles were awesome  br    br   the movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison  he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture  these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman  he than takes his revenge  as the snowman  on the police officer who convicted him  br    br   this movie had such bad acting  with the exception of christopher allport  that is was funny  i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror  but in fact a dark sitcom  they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn t executed right  all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying  but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783518,any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn t bother with an actual story  it s annoying  those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first  and the story simply tacked on  for this reason we often talk of the story  jumping through hoops  as it twists about  trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion  br    br   the story in  comet over broadway  doesn t just jump through hoops  it s a three ring circus  it s so ludicrous  so ill conceived  so disingenuous that  if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen  you will be carrying on quite a rant before it s through  br    br   the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession  since it s all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion  so  in the end there s no point to the story  the theme becomes irrelevant and  as is often the case with poor screenplays  the acting doesn t save a thing

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080520,i really looked forward to this program for two reasons  i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters  i don t like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level  the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago  the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960 s  it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter  which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust  br    br   in short  no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight  and the bell 222  the  actor  that portrayed airwolf wasn t very fast even by helicopter standards  and it didn t stay in production very long  br    br   there was a movie that came out during this time period called  blue thunder  that was much more realistic

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102722,ok  not possibly  honestly the worst movie i ve ever seen  br    br   this made absolutely no sense  there was no plot  no characterization  no acting  just nothing  br    br   here s what i thought when i first saw it may 28th  2003   caution  this is a spoiler alert  it s also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is   br    br   ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced  but there is no character explanation  as far as i knew the main character was new to this school  but apparently not  also it appeared that he lived by himself    then that he was a foster kid    then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still  also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves  br    br   now we come to a main plot point  this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant  now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus  intently on him for the contingency of the movie  i think i must have missed a main plot element here  there was no reason for the main character to get hooked  even if that s the point  having no reason  why do all his friends  who are skeptical like 5 minutes before  suddenly follow him and do what he wants  br    br   so the movie continues on  and it gets all right  they re running havoc on the school  blah blah blah  but wait a minute    suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the  show  here  wait a second  didn t the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that  it was supposed to be anynomous  br    br   ah another important plot element has been skipped over    the insane guy was supposed to not be insane    everyone said he wasn t insane  but as the story goes on  he is very clearly out of his mind  but i thought the news people said he wasn t    hm    br    br   now the movie comes to a close  that was the close  what the hell was that  not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character  it didn t answer any questions about the insane guy  are these people in the same situation  if yes  then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this  if no then what is the point in saying  that s you in two weeks     br    br    end of the thing     br    br   that s what i thought then  that is pretty much what i still think now  it s 6 months down the line  and if i can get it for free  i might give it another chance  but i doubt it  i highly doubt it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923293,this film was a critical and box office fiasco back in 1957  it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play  which flopped on broadway  the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii  they have 4 day s leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel  the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real  cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama  but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn t really pull it off  tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices  audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant  but had other commitments  so suzy parker stepped in  she had never acted before  but was america s top photographic model at the time  i think that she did a good job  considering all the pressure that she was under  grant s pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes  did not really work  the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant  but the character had no substance at all 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071198,i ve tried to like this film  really  in watching it  all i can think is   this guy gives me the creeps  i would have gotten a restraining order   it also calls out codependence in capital letters  was this really the conversation before making the movie   let s make a film that puts two chronically depressed  socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are   from what i ve seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self pity   br    br   the mood of the movie is distinctly 80 ish  brooding and slow  don t get me wrong  the film has its moments  just very few of them 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049653,haunted boat sells itself as  the fog  meets  open water   in many ways this is accurate  there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested  br    br   however the acting ability is poor at best  showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film  which in all credit they do to the best of their ability  when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects  with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on  br    br   many aspects of the film are creepy and strange  but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused  in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well  ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end  you actually want to know what is going on  and are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax  br    br   this is no ghost ship but it ll definitely do for an evening in front of the t v 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818,checking the spoiler alert just in case  br    br   perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen  mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life  the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious  but just ended up being funny since they were so bad  evil dead anyone  unfortunately for m m  fortunately for us  it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy  this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character  robbie  played by hanks  encountered throughout the film  it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the 80s  br    br   if you want to avoid wasting your time and money  steer clear of this junk  br    br   p s    even though the cover looks kinda interesting  which is why i guess my brother bought it  it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm  unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473310,when a friend gave me a boxed set of  12 amazing scifi horror movies   i was understandably a little cautious  but  since the item was a gift  i really didn t truly pay my common sense much heed  after all    movies for free  so what if they are a little ropey  after much consideration  alien intruder was the first of those movies  ironically  it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch  all i can say is  if this is the best of them  i shudder to think what the rest are like  br    br   on the surface  it had some good things going for it  four  count  em   actors that i was familiar with  billy dee williams  tracy scoggins  maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway  i told myself    billy and tracy have been in some good scifi  star wars and babylon 5  respectively  so they wouldn t sign up for a turkey  max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film    but not too shoddy an actor  an jeff    well   he s done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go   i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add  the ugly  to his repertoire of movies  br    br   the first clue was in the opening scenes  jeff mugs his way with gusto through an  i m mad  scene before finally killing himself  an amusing cameo performance  really  unfortunately this is  without much exaggeration  the highlight of the film  it goes downhill from there  br    br   next up we have the commander of the mission  williams  who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element  but this assortment aren t so much the dirty dozen   more like the unconvincing foursome  plus  one of the crims  a computer hacker  is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer  isn t that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer  pretty lame prison  if you ask me  br    br   when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible  it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kits  br    br   but the horror doesn t stop there  whilst on route to the area where jeff s ship vanished  the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality  in which they indulge their male fantasies  all well and good  and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the  alien menace  which begins to appear there  but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong  alien intruder  alien boring  more like  br    br   finally they make it to g sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left  the ending  in truly optimistic rubbish film vein  hints at a sequel   as if  also making an appearance in this movie is a character i ll nickname the  sweatdroid   he s supposed to be an android  but apparently that fact was lost on the make up crew  who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity  but don t worry  he s just there to make up the body count numbers at the end  br    br   williams and scoggins  to be truthful  do very little in the film  they only just barely stay awake  let alone act  and  as i mentioned earlier  jeff gets an early trip to the showers  so his manicness isn t allowed to enlighten much of the film  max tries his best  as do a couple of the other cast members  but the movie is just direly atrocious  to be honest  br    br   the one  and only  half way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention  they are all named after musicians   holly  presley  joplin  the rest of the film is bland and uninspired  br    br   made in 1992  i had thought  on initial viewing  it was one of those 80 s straight to video jobs  looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90 s  it seems  br    br   it s best avoided  even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker  but at least you can fast forward it  i suppose 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198,when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt    try not to gag on a fur ball  br    br   i like albert brooks  i ve seen most  if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one  modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love  there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance  although 1979 s chilly scenes of winter comes very close  they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted obsessed to their respective women  br    br   where as chilly scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking  this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship   and out of the relationship   and back in it again  br    br   and because it s a movie that was released in 1981  it is of its time in terms of styles and such  that s the main reason i like this movie  my basic rule when it comes to movies is  if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance   you know time capsule stuff  br    br   which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirt  br    br   the man is hair  very hair  like he s wearing a black curly fur sweater hairy  and what s worse is he almost looks burn victim hairy  it s not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on  back in the early 80 s hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking  but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting  sorry  albert  i wish at some point someone said  hey let s try this scene but with you wearing a simple t shirt  i mean you might scare people   it s just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers  she was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that  br    br   anyway  it s an ok movie  it could have been better if i hadn t see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095158,one of the worst movies i ve ever seen with robert de niro  the fan is a pointless clich  of an exercise in slasher flicks  it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic   the movie meanders into nothing   spoiler  we re to believe that a knife wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness  security  or cameras  the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky  not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie  this is as big a dud as they come  stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469151,there are really two sections of this film  firstly there s the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the  the simpsons  troy mcclure should be doing the narration  br    br   then the rest of the film begins  starting off with a title song which really doesn t fit in with the rest of the film  which  while technically ok  is killed by a vague  inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters  but characters that make no sense  br    br   this is especially so with mickey rooney s spiventa  who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the  organisation  the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out  in that case he would ve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character  which in the end he still is  br    br   the overall problem of the film is that it s totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy  it s as if the filmmakers didn t have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions  br    br   put simply  the film fails on all levels 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425638,there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70 s  and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them off hand is a measure of their impact  these are what novelists would call  pot boilers   they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie stars in the public eye  br    br   we have micheal caine  peter ustinov  omar sharif  rex harrison and william holden  more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats  every taste in hero is catered for  though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed  br    br   their talents are simply thrown away  and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense  this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv  sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round  br    br   it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset  that ludicrously mismatched jaunty jazz theme music  which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed  had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak  who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa  or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop  definitely a serious goof ball  ennio morricone would have known what to do  and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points  this director should have taken the trouble to watch  lawrence of arabia   or even sergio leone s westerns  he might have learnt a few things  but then again  probably he wouldn t  br    br   alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film  frantic   it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford  in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible  here  when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado  rex harrison kept popping up out of no where like some wily old genii  to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled   br    br   at least the photography was rather good  with excellent use of the often beautiful environment  but then the dumb music must pipe up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created  br    br   action scenes were also contrived and stilted  with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first year drama class  and  of course  the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment   as you do  br    br   and that s about as much comment as this item deserves  except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well  br    br   stick with your hobby on this one  even if it contained your favourite movie stars  you re sure to be disappointed too 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903014,i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was  i am so glad i didn t pay to see this movie and that i didn t sit in a movie theater for this one  where to begin on this movie  the acting in this movie was average  the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn t special  i thought that this movie was suppose to be great  but it wasn t more than a cheesy waste of time  i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry  it just wasn t there  i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn t get the feeling that he wasn t acting in this movie  now  alice eve did a great job as an actress but  there was no chemistry between her and jay  all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie  the humor in this movie was not funny at all  there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand  i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn t decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy  i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials  i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director  the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality  but what a letdown nothing  i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie  i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie  so save yourself the agony and just don t see it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087507,this is an awful film  yea the girls are pretty but its not very good  the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn t get in the way  well  okay it might be interesting  but its not  because its so badly paced and and only partly acted  i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen  probably more laughable then they do on tv   i won t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest  never read about that in the old west  this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward  br    br   i like schlock films but this is ridiculous  there is a reason that i don t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good  the plot taking a back seat to breasts  the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats  the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent  the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level  infantile but harmlessly fun  something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie  br    br   the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film  br    br   i need not watch this again  br    br   of interest to probably no one  the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil  a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped  br    br   obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245192,although this seems to be quite an old show  2002   i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show       ever  br    br   i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to  and i am only assuming that this was their target audience  children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq  br    br   the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines  tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship  family  religion and politics      br    br   basic story that they covered in the episode  frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol   death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate  death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said  no  to mean mulit millionaire  everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi  ex girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie  disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience  senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son  he gives money freely to lots of broke students   all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is  at that age  and has a crush on a boy  who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty  but only to dump him because the  in  girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him  don t worry  she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the  in  girls drop her  aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on  i was almost sick at this point   br    br   this  drama  gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is       your gonna laugh at this  i sure did        br    br   it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral                br    br   the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br    br   why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line  watching this show is like watching  last action hero  with arnie killing 5 000 people with a tooth pick  except arnie is a better actor  wow  never thought there would be a day that i would say that     br    br   in the words of the simpsons beloved character  comic book guy           br    br   worst tv show           ever 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447987,one question  why  first off  the premise is not funny or engaging at all  they use taped interviews  and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts  first off  the interviews aren t funny or entertaining to begin with  and even if they were  i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally  without being turned into cartoons  how does that add any hilarity to it  i turned on cbs s monday night sitcom line up   which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays  and found this on  of course  the sitcom line up would be reruns anyway  being summer  but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining  i tried to give  cc  a chance  i really did  when it started  i figured  well  maybe it will be funny  nope  and then it kept going  it was a long half hour  br    br   and i can almost see if there was a purpose  if the interviews were shown in their entirety  and had points to them  but no  it was just one line clips  cut and pasted together really quick  it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network s  robot chicken   i wasn t a fan of cbs  now cancelled sitcom  the class   while that was on  it was one half hour of the line up i would struggle through  but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of  creatures     let s just say i d take the  class   considering it s been a couple hours since it aired  and i come on here to see i am the first to comment   i guess that s a good sign that nobody watched it  and that it won t last much longer  cartoon roadkill

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311018,this movie is about a female rape victim comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty  run down small town where she finds refuge in a single wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere  the townspeople are mentally ill  yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer  annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance  db sweeney s performance was high school at best  he s one of those kinda cute young actors with a sweet grin  unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow  to the previous commentator stating that the acting was  so real   well i agree  actually it wasn t acting  the two main characters really are pathetic  weak and incapable of making mature  healthy decisions  in brief  this movie sucks like no other  rent it to laugh at it  the real crime scene  the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer   enough to make me commit murder  and lastly  she s a artist writer  so couldn t she afford a double wide trailer and something other than a sun yellow chevy chevette for love of god 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417148,dire  just dire  the script is contrived  the acting painful  and the story just drags along  it is  without a doubt  a celebration of sally potter and little else  this wouldn t be so bad  but she s the director  writer and star of the film  and so is just self glorification  i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters  and the ending came not a moment too soon  it has two redeeming features  first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely  particularly in paris  and look rather good in black and white  secondly  whether you re a fan of tango or not  the music is by and large  excellent  except where sally starts singing   watch this film at your own risk  or if you need an unintentional laugh  i am sure it appeals to someone  statistically  it has to 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095904,sondra locke stinks in this film  but then she was an awful  actress  anyway  unfortunately  she drags everyone else  including then  real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her  but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one  one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer  it s an exceptionally weak story  basically no story or plot at all  add in bored  poor acting  even from the normally good eastwood  there s absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned  this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers  wow  could a film be any more boring  i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun  a real stinker  don t bother with this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480586,this is is a thoroughly unpleasant  if slickly made  movie  i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum  two good actors  and because the plot line   a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution   sounded promising  the movie is billed as a comedy  sorta  what we have is an endless series of shots   you should pardon the pun   of people in dimly lit and elegant  if somewhat surreal  interiors  shooting each other   in the head  stomach  kneecap  foot  heart  no part of the anatomy is avoided  it seems  while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue  some of which is supposed  evidently  to be humorous in a sort of post modern way  goldblum s dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card  and he wears a single facial expression   a sardonic grin   throughout  ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can  burt reynolds does a cameo  the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop  but i somehow missed them  good move on their part   the whole thing is cold  sterile  mechanical and unsavory  an heir  i suspect  to the style of  pulp fiction    fargo  and  natural born killers   if you liked those  you ll probably like this 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478197,poor paul mercurio  after landing the role of scott hastings in strictly ballroom  the best film in history  he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish  none of the characters in this film is very unlikable  or even hateable  but mercurio s lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore   completely unloveable and he wears overalls  big mistake in costume design  that one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365653,well  jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie  the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay  but  although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion  i am an atheist   it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end  why is this movie so incredibly boring  i don t know  it just is and so it is not recommendable 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499570,this show is dull  lame  and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it  original   first off  the animation is so ugly    johnny s hideous    and everyone s annoying  the twins look like teen female dexters from  dexter s lab   and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee  also from  dexter s lab    secondly  the plots    are painfully lame  making them hard to follow  the gags are corny  and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit    especially when it tries to be funny  i only saw two episodes  but those alone turned me off  br    br   third off  the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green day s  american idiot   and  while i am not a big fan of that band  i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody  and then subtly change it  in order to make it their own  br    br   case in point    it s a big fat ugly bore  1 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120361,spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help  i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point  lee s first movie with an all white cast is a major disappointment  br    br   what s the point  that italians swear and like funky sex  but not with their wives  if i wanted to see scorsese  i d go to a scorsese movie  the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype  br    br   i ve admired several of lee s films  especially  do the right thing   this movie is a waste of time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453671,oh dear  good cast  but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task  even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right  im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times  the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue  that made some people in the film annoying  it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task  and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film  overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me  but i m sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good  sorry 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088915,ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with  now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list  i don t see how so many people could be scared by this movie  i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one  the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me  as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best  oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why  the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning  how does that scare someone  i can make that noise easily  now don t get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn t even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314630,ok  let me again admit that i haven t seen any other merchant ivory  the distributor  films  nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director  so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated  with that admittance  let me begin  br    br   before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn t know which genre it wants to be  at first  it pretends to be a romance  in most romances  the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character  is separated from the supporting character  and is  sometimes  united with his or her partner  this movie s hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her  his name is henry moores and her name is sajani  and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj  british imperial rule   henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid  despite his legal marriage and child overseas  what could be better than that  they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them  word spreads to sajani s husband who questions her involvement with moores  she denies any contact with him  but moores asks her to leave the area  sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide  please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film  the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions  br    br   sajani s body is discovered right as moores  family comes to visit  the alleged perpetrator is moores s english educated assistant t k  t k  knows of his master s affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened  once he is declared innocent  he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores  t k  is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall  br    br   i want to warn you  this isn t a romance film  the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting  this image is captured directly from the film s opening  but quickly disappears  then it s over  it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love  it isn t effective  at all  not only is the movie not a romance  but its characters lack any personality  they are bundles of walking clich s  moores is an arrogant white man who doesn t recognize his indian friend  t k  s intelligence  t k  is torn between his own heritage and his educative background  sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life  oh  and  of course  moores  family is inquisitive into sajani s death but still slightly racist to indians  if the tone wasn t so serious  i would be willing to overlook these problems  but it isn t  the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development  br    br   no  this film isn t terrible  other than the laughable screenplay  it isn t poor  the actors are all experienced and perform well here  nandita das  who plays sajani  was part of wonderful indian drama water  even director sivan has an impressive resume  he recently oversaw the terrorist  which is part of roger ebert s  great movies  collection  what happened here  why is this movie so bad  well  sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs  apparently  the story was  timeless   and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930 s india  i don t have any problem with that approach  but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time  the actors  cinematography  and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan s aura  you ll probably not enjoy it  my recommendation is that you presume you aren t in accordance with him and watch something else  final consensus   and   out of      
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182295,yes  people are racist  people are even racist in college  that s a good point  and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films  what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham fisted and predictable way possible  oh yeah it s in college too  br    br   this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems  it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner  most of the characters are cartoonish  one dimensional  caricatures  lesbian feminist  angry black man   that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible  instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them  the angry black men feel cheated  feminists hate men  etc   one feminist even holds a sign that reads  dead men don t rape   see what i mean   i don t want to give anything away  but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they ll probably behave exactly how you expect them to  the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie  the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo nazis will act like violent neo nazis  i ll guess you ll just have to watch to find out what happens  br    br   another problem i have with this movie is that it s supposed to be  gritty  and  hard hitting   but they make nazis the bad guys  i agree nazis are evil  but that s my point  everybody thinks nazis are bad  we re not breaking any new ground here  nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930 s  the film doesn t challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements  it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy  after school special like  manner  being anti rape  anti racist  and anti nazi isn t exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue  br    br   higher learning is predictable  cartoonish  and in a word stupid  avoid at all costs 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100419,i am writing this review having watched it several months ago    the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie  it is a complete joke    and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre  1974  which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art  the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers    hell he might not even be good at that either  the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn t even see the actor s faces sometimes  i don t even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really  bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable  that s all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don t do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained  br    br   if you want good quality low budget fun  far better than this    then check out a jeff hayes film    because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it  br    br   i gave this 1 star just for the cover art    thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called  film  br    br    rick blalock
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0263265,it was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies  the brain is well done  the script reminded me of videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before  the acting can go through with it  but it s the effects that makes you laugh  the so called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown  the opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching  the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of nightmare on elm street  remember the telephone coming alive     some how you keep watching this flick  waiting what is happening next  it s viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn t any gore in it and as said the blood isn t there neither but there is nudity for the perverts  i have seen worser movies than this one  only wished they had made it bloodier   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089308,i just saw this at the venice film festival  and can t quite decide about it  we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them  maybe that was the point  that we are all in a  bubble  of our own  but these people didn t compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates  at a running time of just over an hour  the characters weren t very well developed  lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment  forklifts  conveyor belts  shovels   and the slightly creepy looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes  that most of the characters made for a living  were somehow more interesting than the live people  an interesting experiment  but somehow it never quite came together 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790781,did anyone who was making this movie  particularly the director  spare a thought for the logic of the story line  these are not mere plot holes  but plot graves  that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight  that is  if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave hole plot  or boring and unlikeable  or  in the case of downey s   hannah s characters  apparently superfluous  in pondering the reason for existence of downey s character s significant screen time in the movie  i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen time  unlikley  as the director didn t change anything else about the script he actually needed to  or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting  i ll leave you to guess which one it was to be  br    br   i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents  i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job  surely he has some power to pick and chose  actually  i can t understand why anyone would take this script on  except a first time director looking for the experience  br    br   i suppose robert downey jr  needed the money for his habit  i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent  i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing  these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie  as for robert altman  plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic  i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene  or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye s movements  or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood  i do not typically notice such things in movies  since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story telling and interesting characters with understandable motives  i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that  due to the talent involved  there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie  br    br   nice direction  but that s not why i watch movies 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295289,i ll try to use words to describe this on      br    br   i saw the original  which was good in its own way  but back then i should have feared a sequel  br    br   and i was  afraid  when i picked this one up  but now that i ve seen it  i have to say  it s even worse then i thought  why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin   br    br   let s start with the actors they aren t all that good  but it has to be said  some make heads turn by being just plain awful  but what can an actor do with a script like this one  it s trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed  any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn t been done before  fails miserably  in a futile attempt to get it up to date  they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole  big brother  theme   but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end  an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the  83 original  but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad  in conclusion  if you have nothing   and i mean nothing   to do    go watch it  or play frisbee    with the dvd     by yourself  it ll offer you the same amount of fun   i promise
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051141,darcy and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her mum s boyfriend peter left his doctor s position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn  although this inn has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl s who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house  they called her the  tooth fairy  as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth  this work on the inn  has awoken the  tooth fairy   now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth  but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits pamela  br    br   this flick s old folk myth of the  tooth fairy  doesn t paint her in a very generous way  as you would believe when you were a child  don t they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares  another one which did fall into the same category was  darkness falls  2003    i can t compare how similar they are in the premises  because i haven t seen the latter  but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea  for a little straight to dvd film  this dtv effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device  low expectations are needed  as i wouldn t class it as an success  but i found it be to marginally entertaining  br    br   cory strode and cookie rae brown s story or background for this  tooth fairy  character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural  silly is a good way to describe what s happening in this poorly scripted story  but it never really feels like a fairytale horror  the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded  while the acting is simply sub par with the bland characters they have to work off  but director chuck bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts  this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense  the zero scares and generic tone  his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able  where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography  the promising opening scene is creepily effective  his pacing can slow up in parts and there s the odd and unnecessary slow motion scene put in  but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn t bored  br    br   the make up special effects provided the goods  as there s enough repulsive gruel and the tooth fairy s appearance is especially gooey  the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black robe  bubbling make up and swift movements  being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness  child actors can be incredibly annoying  but nicole mu oz was decent in her part  lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid  but can be a little too causal in their performances as peter and darcey  the radiantly gorgeous carrie anne fleming is one of their lodgers  p j soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn  br    br   i thought it was a okay time waster that has a sound concept  which just isn t fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff  watchable nonsense  but at the same time extremely forgettable

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033512,this movie is so bad  you almost feel contaminated by it  actually  there is a strong sense of relief when it s over  relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection  i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would  phone in  his performance  i meant that he would not be trying very hard  but lo and behold  in a huge number of scenes in this film  bill hurt is actually on the phone  our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess  the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled  the story is chaotic  and the soundtrack is barely audible  there is a very slight resemblance to  falling down   but that film had a boldly disturbing story line  great writing and acting  and an engaging soundtrack   contaminated man  is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap  and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don t speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up  you get the picture  don t get this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758781,as an avid fan of cary grant  i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter  as amc billed it as a comedy  i have never been more disappointed with a film  cary s usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie  he comes across as strained  bored  and just not himself  mississip s character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed   his accent is terribly exaggerated  and incorrect  according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from   and whenever he does deliver a line  it s several decibels higher than any other cast member  mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable  country bumpkin goofball  but in the end  he manages only to detract from the already weak plot  mansfield looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex kitten  and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability  this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with  ray walston s character was sugary and ultimately contrived  for four men on shore leave  it was the tamest leave i ve ever seen  i watched this nightmare until its very end  and while i won t spoil that for anyone  i will tell you that it s the most absurd you ll ever see  the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men  but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast  sorry  cary

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074829,at a panel discussion that i attended after viewing this film  the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought  well  the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie  the gimmicks of the film  documentary style  futuristic setting  served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate  this film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views   usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040869,i went to see this film based on the review by siskel and ebert  not only did i get duped  but i took some friends along  and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap  after this  i never went to see a movie based solely on siskel   ebert s advice 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346156,great mystery  but the film goes down hill from there  the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer  edward  he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills  a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter  so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman  they don t like outsiders  a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl  that made the movie too long  it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward  br    br   overall  not a well written story and too long   br    br   final verdict  i would skip this 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088760,this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c  scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt  jane eyre  to the screen  and how much can go wrong in doing so  it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd   some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence  but even if the editing were better  the film would not be  the script is bad  the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast  as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte bront  s novel at all  the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out   this is the case with all the short adaptations   but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone  the spirit  the atmosphere and the concept of the novel  br    br   this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with jane s arrival at lowood  while this is perfectly all right  since some scenes must by necessity be left out  it is not understandable that  instead of using the time gained  so to speak  and thoroughly portraying jane s friendship with helen  the influence helen has for jane s development  the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her  the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill treatment of helen  which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation  what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel  but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward  who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death  and this is about all which happens at lowood  if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel  one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane s life  and this is the problem throughout this adaptation  it rushes from scene to scene  very often without transition  and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel  the dialogues are an odd mixture of made up lines and lines from the novel  very clumsily patched together  and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love  and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance  the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel  but the scriptwriter not only did bront  s language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set up with just one sentence  when rochester and jane go to see rochester s wife after the would be wedding  rochester says   yet i once loved her  his wife  as i love you now   the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved  and that his effort to seek a true life partner is  if not sanctified by god s and man s law  yet understandable and forgivable  but this one sentence completely undermines bront  s whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer  br    br   from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting  now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays  but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely  blonde  blue eyed and full mouthed susannah york as the novel s plain heroine  in addition  ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it  played by her  the novel s shy  reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised  graceful and mature woman  completely sure of herself and her deserts  i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not bront  s jane eyre  to cast george c  scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible  scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70  br    br   to compliment the  maturity  of the leading actors all passion  desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script  the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding  the emotional climax of the novel  has become a calm  rational conversation between two middle aged persons  at the end of which rochester falls asleep  when jane returns to him in the last scene  he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people s home by his favourite granddaughter  the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st  john  of all people  ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for jane s love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st  john on the rochester of the novel  but good though bannen is  his st  john is just as far from the novel as york s jane and scott s rochester  the only redeeming features of this very disappointing  jane eyre  are the locations and the score  and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of  jane eyre  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087258,the movie was terrible    easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years  one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of  thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question  what is the worst movie you have seen   answer  celestine prophecy  trust me   i read the book  enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie  but then  they treated the audience like we are r tarded  there is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence  it is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can t simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow  they didn t spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died  it was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie  the book is pretty boring too but i enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book  the film does not offer the same opportunity and i would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart  don t see this movie  trust me 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226,err   this movie sucked  a lot  br    br   i have been reading some of the other reviews  apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good    br    br   i have watched several of his films  in the vain hope that i m missing something  but no  they just suck  poorly written trash  the characters are all very stereotypical  not to mention rather stupid   the plot is   i think it is supposed to be mysterious  not sure on that  mr  allen s character is   woody allen  on any other film you have seen of his  br    br   if you are a fan of woody allen  go see this film  if you are under 50  don t bother   if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under 50   well  you are atypical  i don t know what to say  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762115,all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains  although the children were much more sadistic in scctm  i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie  as a spanish assignment in spanish 5 we all had to watch it  i ll tell you  usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food  but not for this movie  everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr  pitch was going to do next  would merlin help santa claus    or would his robot reindeer come and save the day  i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that   d
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308132,one can only assume that robert osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him extolling the  virtues  of this  charming  film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv  seeing as any old film on imdb receives  classic  status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers  i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film  br    br   this is not your father s  shop around the corner   for all my quibbles with  you ve got mail   it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable  for those who have seen the original  the flaws will only be all the more obvious  br    br   from one of the lamest meet cute sequences i can recall seeing  a sad slapstick attempt at  humor    this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step  this  musical  only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term  there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there s judy singing  i don t care  while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure  the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here  miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films  but here she seems horribly miscast  the role was originally to have been filled by june allyson and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret sullavan s old part  van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type  the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewart sullavan or even that of hanks ryan  br    br   this is a film that knows  some of  the notes  but not the music  it doesn t really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van johnson s character to complicate things unnecessarily  the remake s substitution for the original s infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin  it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of three s company by someone with a delorean and a flux capacitor  it s really just an excuse for a keaton pratfall  even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled  after seeing both films  you ll understand why they called it  the lubitsch touch  and not the  robert z  leonard touch   br    br   avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garland s earlier films unless you re an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096870,this is not really a zombie film  if we re defining zombies as the dead walking around  here the protagonist  armand louque  played by an unbelievably young dean jagger   gains control of a method to create zombies  though in fact  his  method  is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people s minds turning them into hypnotized slaves  this is an interesting concept for a movie  and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of  dr  mabuse  films  including  dr  mabuse the gambler   1922  and  the testament of dr  mabuse   1933   here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc e  claire duvall  played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo  dorothy stone  which is really the major theme  br    br   the movie has an intriguing beginning  as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there  at some type of compound  where we get great 30s sets and clothes  he announces his engagement to claire  and then barely five minutes later  she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal  clifford greyson  robert noland   it s unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact  this would have been a great movie for  mystery science theater 3000   if they hadn t already roasted it  br    br   it s never shown how louque actually learns the  zombification  secret  but he then uses it to kill his enemies  create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards  we won t see such sheer force of will until john agar in  the brain from planet arous   1957   br    br   finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america  louque agrees  but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves  on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his  powers   to gain her love  he does so  causing the  revolt  of the title  in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him  greyson embraces claire  and we seem to be at the end of a parable   whom the gods would destroy  they first make mad    br    br   so really then  it s not that bad of a film  despite the low imdb rating it currently has  on repeated viewings     one can see the artistry in the well formed script  dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor  and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness    is that really his own hair  we remember him more for his bald  old man roles in  white christmas   1954    x the unknown   1956  and  king creole   1958   the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better  earlier film  white zombie   1932  in which hapless robert frazier  as charles beaumont  uses  zombification  to win the love of madge bellamy  as madeline parker   br    br   if you want real zombie movies  of which there are hundreds   i d start with  white zombie   1932    king of the zombies   1941    i walked with a zombie   1943    night of the living dead   1968    the last man on earth   1964  and its two remakes  in the modern era of classy films  there are  horror express   1972    the serpent and the rainbow   1988    28 days later   2002  and its sequel  as well as many  many  others too numerous to mention  br    br   this one is not really a zombie film  judging this movie on its own terms  it s more of a semi gothic romance  as such it ranks a little below some of universal s bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s  so i ll give it a 5 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068235, a guy thing  tries to capture the feeling of  there s something about mary  or  meet the parents  but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films  thankfully i rented it on a 5 day rental because i couldn t sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time  br    br   the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul s missteps  the checker at the save mart was great  but the script writing is absolutely horrible  the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason  plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need  br    br   don t get me wrong  slapstick humor is great when it s smartly done as in the other films i mentioned  but this movie simply misses the mark  too bad as i love julia stiles  ten things i hate about you was great  but even that couldn t help me sit through this terrible movie  save your dollars and go rent  there s something about mary  one more time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070000,admittedly  i didn t have high expectations of  corky romano   but then again  who did  however  i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt  i had no high hopes of  joe dirt  either  another recent comedy starring an snl cast member  and i ended up being pleasantly surprised  but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews  chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor  contrary to what you might think after watching this movie  with great energy  he s been in many hilarious snl skits  and i think he s one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now  in this case  he s given a lame  pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging  throughout each scene  he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably  jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy  not to mention he worked with much better writing  kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes  he doesn t even wait for the punchline  he assumes we ll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack  in one scene  he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth  the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him  he comes back to the job  strung out on coke  now  how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he s acting hyper and on edge  when he s doing the same thing throughout the whole film   br    br   as for the rest of the cast members   vanessa shaw is really hot  peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn  peter falk is also wasted  though he has a few funny lines that i m pretty sure he improvised  i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon  that s too much talent too waste on a clunker like  corky romano   i didn t like falk s last movie  made  all that much either  but at least he had a decent role   br    br   i chuckled a few times  but i could not get a single laugh  each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery  and it s made worse by kattan s hammy acting  and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out  for example  when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers  faces  he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes  trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it s a little tiny one  it s bad enough when you have a gag that s funny and drag it out  but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it s a hell of a lot worse  and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust  i can go on and on about what s wrong with this so called comedy  but i m not gonna waste my time  like i said earlier  if you predicted bad things from the trailers  you predicted right   br    br   my score  3  out of 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100649,urgh  3 things a movie needs  a good script  a good plot and good casting  i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible  i lost the will to live halfway through  the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne  who was the reason for me watching it in the first place   she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasn t changed much since she was 13  it was a fantastic first effort in a movie  the dog was also very good  both did a great job with such awful material  sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie  she was completely miscast  and i don t think she ever quite got the character  br    br   i give the movie 2 out of 10   and thats only because of rose

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431768,the screaming skull  1 outta 5 stars  this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits  an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie  a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music  but  sadly  the movie is all downhill from there  a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion    admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs  has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past  well  in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can  her husband assures her that it s all merely in her mind and    well  you can probably see where this all is going  you will have figured out what s going on long before our hapless heroine    because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows  and done better  too   to add to the movie s myriad transgressions  most cuts of this movie  on numerous cheap dvd compilations  seem to be missing a few key scenes  you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window    she goes to open it    you know she is going to see something scary    and then    suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband s arms  so what did she see    i guess we ll never know 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869,it s been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad   the acting is very average  the story is horribly boring  and i m at a loss for words as to the execution  it was completely unoriginal  o  and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood s a pregnant schwarzenegger   br    br   one of the first scenes  the one with the television show   where the hell are you   got it right   the cast was 80  of let s face it   forgotten actors  if they were hoping for a career relaunch  then i think it might never happen with this on their cv  the script had the potential  but neither 80  of the actors nor the director  who s an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor  pulled it off  fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest  br    br   i m sorry  but if you ever consider watching this   i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic  because not only it s a total loss of time  but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106753,movie  there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie  its truly awful  not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it  it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick  characters actors  denzel has done  exactly  what he does in every movie  so no surprise there  here is a little mind game for the readers  quickly think of 10 denzel movies  now count how many of them were in which he played a cop detective body guard  whatever  clive owen  hmmmmmm  this guy needs a better role on his plate soon  his best performance was i think in  beyond borders   other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well  his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in  sin city   surely this guy knows acting  what he doesn t know is better way of choosing roles  he is in desperate need of a better agent  jodie foster was brilliant in the movie  if you are watching her for the first time in your life  she has done better  she has had better roles  it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie  plot  plot was not confusing  in fact  i could think of such a plot  in fact the whole movie  while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner  i mean come on      spoiler on the way      i am sick of the un necessary haulocast and the racism token  the movie is about bank robbers  why put the haulocast and the racism in there  nice try playing with people s emotions  worked on anyone  not me  police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages  riiiiiiight  please  we re talking about us police force and security here  nobody could find out where clive was  i mean they didn t find anything different with that room  who re we kidding  conclusion  sure  go watch this movie  if nothing  you ll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was  at least people won t think you re stupid to go watch this movie because they d think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast  mistake  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377057,this movie       i don t know  why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin  i will never know  why they would spend money on art direction and some not all that bad special effects  then not bother to edit it properly  i will never know  why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period  and sometimes bizarrely not  why they commissioned such bad songs  why the script doesn t make any sense whatsoever  not even on a silly  children s film level          what were they thinking   nothing about this movie is quite as it should be  every single part is dubbed  and always poorly   every sound effect is slightly wrong  every edit is in the wrong place  every performance is bad in some way  it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere  despite all the problems  but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren s creation

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156524,the first one was different and funny  this attempt should have never left the studio  this movie does not make you laugh  it is a weak attempt at gross out humor  the movie picks out current and old movies to rip off  this time the jokes seem used and overdone  the audience that i saw it with only re acted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103596,the movie is steeped in religion  so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it  in my opinion  this movie pretends to explore deep issues  but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices  with little true insight  what the people in the movie  and therefore  the writer  failed to see was grace  they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds  to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful  and both the man   the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty  is just an oversimplification  such stereotypes really don t exist  for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife s pleasure before his own  scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh  and that no man ever hated his own flesh  but he nourishes and cherishes it  even if you want to ignore the new testament  the writers   characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament  and the even the book of proverbs which says   rejoice in the wife of thy youth  let her breasts satisfy you always   how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows  and approves of  and smiles on  the marital union and the enjoyment thereof  real men don t ignore the value and needs of their wives  those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo christian religion  god never said those things  it s absurd  sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham  it didn t need to be so  how sad  what sonia desperately needed was truth  not tradition  in knowing  loving and obeying god  we love others more  before ourselves  that is the faith of the god of abraham  isaac  jacob   joseph  once for all delivered to the saints  bought   paid for by jesus christ  the righteous  but alright  ignore all this and abandon ancient  holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people   ghosts  that s a good plan  i would never recommend this movie  partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic  but also because it really doesn t offer any valuable insight  check out  yentl  if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113313,the plot was dull  the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accent someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people  there were literally no redeeming features about this film  br    br   i think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again  with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason  br    br   i hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business  they have no place in it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242998,here we are  two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth    one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life  another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race  br    br   so what could we call this killing machine  it s almost like he s some kind of destroyer  or eradicator    sort of like an exterminator or something  what s the word i m looking for    something that  terminates  things  hmmmm     br    br   anyway  the protector  who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing  finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future born hero to be  the evil uhhhh     exterminator  kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes  then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people s eyes and repeating her name threateningly  br    br   then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable  exterminator  pursues the couple across the countryside  at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle  but i m not sure  br    br   perhaps  in an exciting finale  he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of    acid  then the truck will crash  they will be saved    but no  he will then re emerge  as strong as ever  he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant  where in a terrifying finish  he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery  and destroyed once and for all  br    br   but maybe i m extrapolating too much    after all  i did stop watching this movie after mr  protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar  then tells her the child will be born in 3 days   br    br   the costumes and effects are great in this movie    i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek  next generation too  sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant  and career sweat hog stephen baldwin is also on board as young s fat cop boyfriend  not sure where he fits into the plot though    maybe he s an import from a different james cameron movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352394,i am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one  or vice versa  being that it is nearly fifteen years since i saw this film  the fact that i remember so little about it does not bode well  perhaps it is simply because i only watched it once or twice  but i doubt it  if there was anything worth remembering about this film  you can rest assured i would remember it  br    br   at the time this film was released  the franchise was still entering its dying phase  so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it  it s never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics  one such article had to explain that freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans  so he decides to go after alice s unborn son  so far  so good  but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience  it should not be left to some unrelated publication  br    br   making use of the trivia given in part three about freddy s conception  one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the  horror for infants  category  but alas  that was not to be  it goes to show the sheer idiocy of the american ratings system that a piece of b harni esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original  br    br   by this time  the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career  fortunately  or unfortunately depending on how you look at it  lisa wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting  or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast  either way  given that her last role was in something called the all new adventures of chastity blade  i doubt she really had anything else going for her  even poor old robert englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years  br    br   given that box office returns were in a steady decline  and not just for this franchise  at the time  one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable  in fact  this particular film  like its immediate predecessor  was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience  both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise  despite this  part five must be given some credit for not having the bright  luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at  br    br   i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten  by trying to appeal to everyone  or the mpaa s idea of everyone  it succeeds in appealing to noone  like parts two and four  one could erase it from the continuity entirely  and nobody would notice the difference 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459387,the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor  a holocaust survivor  part of mengele s experiments on twins  consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz  and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments  the movie obviously had great reviews  it s one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about  br    br   i too  for a large part of the movie  got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on  one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder  obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum  could only find the sweetest nectar   in one of the many dramatic sequences  as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center  the meaning of the word  forgive  is even debated  but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own  but by this time  the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more  after the  strong willed  eva kor forgives her  nazi captors  the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about  at least from the viewpoint of kor  the movie goes about following her  past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory  to me  this was the meat of the movie  surrounded by inedible fat of her  act of forgiveness   obviously  it was a very sick cow  br    br   on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness  in order to heal wounds of the past  she makes her way to the  promised land  to meet with some arabs  to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis  including one at a jewish center in chicago  from then on  anyone not so teary eyed that they can t see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements  br    br   firstly  you immediately notice her body language  defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers  her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time  effort and money the entire act was  a rather annoyed dr sami advan  professor of education at bethlehem university  gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment  br    br   finally  the debate at the jewish center in chicago  where she is  grilled  on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so  in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts  br    br   i will cut to the chase  by the end of the movie  i was hoping i hadn t chosen to watch the movie  the movie was badly made  failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial  just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears  it showed that kor  the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion  her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness  at best  to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate  br    br   lastly  is everyone so retarded today that they can t notice the difference between making peace and forgiving  quoting another imdb user   i don t see her forgiveness as being weak  quite the contrary  she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul  she wanted the suffering to be over  so she let it go   that would be the perfect layman s definition of making peace  br    br   i guess  in a world of propaganda  blind faith and political correctness  there is no room to question those that have  gone through more than the human mind can fathom   br    br   p s  the dictionary certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084096,the killings in this movie isn t that bad  but for sure the movie is  it s even worse than that  it s not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd player  br    br   not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd store  not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it  horrible  br    br   it s beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie  it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching  add to that the group pressure from my co watchers  br    br   the manuscript is awful  the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable  br    br   i hope you don t see this as a spoiling your fun  i d rather see it as a fair warning  do not waste your time watching this garbage 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080486,i ve come to realise from watching euro horror  especially films made by cult luminary jess franco  that you can t expect a plot that makes much sense  however  franco has gone overboard with this film  and despite a surreal atmosphere  and the film s reputation as one of the director s best   succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film  i ve got to admit that i saw the american cut version  which runs at about 76 minutes  but unless it was just the logic that was cut  i m sure the longer european version is just as boring  the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around  practicing s m and talking rubbish  and it s all really boring  there s no gore and the sex is dull  and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film  i had difficulty making it all the way to the end  i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere  but the positive elements end there  jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films   but this looks like it was one he made for the money  and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director s more interesting works 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0760179,run away from this movie  even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful  it is also insidious in it s theme  the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring  people who treat others with respect are losers  guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie  see it instead  br    br   no normal kid would do what trent does  state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc  seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche  mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker who yes  has had a terrible life  however  she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her  br    br   usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for  in this case there is none  it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters  the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218619,i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end  after you ve already invested an hour into it  and that s what happened with this film  i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story  i haven t gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends fortunately i didn t pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it  ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting  the wife in particular was so perfect  but milo o shea as a jew      now that was funny  i haven t researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3 4 of the way through the film  before that point  a story and characters were developing there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn t too much time wasted  but ooh that last 1 2 hour  if that wasn t the screwiest  most worthless denouement i ve ever witnessed  i don t know what is  i just hate it when one s faith is so destroyed like that  it feels like an act of violence 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346681,what can i say  a kamal hassan movie being horrible  he acts very well  but it is a horrible story  along with horrible direction  in my kind opinion  the director gautham menon must give up directing  there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie  apart from that  one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes  there was no practicality in the movie  gautham is just running out of stories  but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well  the villains look too ugly  though their performance was not bad  i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family  you will not get sleep seeing this movie   however  harris jayaraj again did a great job  and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10  his song  partha modail nallae  is soulful and soothing  apart from that  great cinematography  on the whole  this is just a bad  bad movie  kamal hassan  i think  should have rejected this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189456, succubus   the edited version of  necronomicon getr umte s nden   is a struggle to sit through  even at a lean 76 minutes  any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma  br    br   jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics  since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever  apparently  this is one of the better of his 180  films   it s hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there  br    br   the unfathomable plot deals with franco s usual themes of sex  violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s m for good measure  and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious  br    br   i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again   life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110763,1993 was the year  this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar  who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him  i was actually a paid extra in  my boyfriend s back   which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown  tx  the original title was  johnny zombie   thank god the producers had a change of heart   i was in the theater scene  i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters  it is more of a comedy than a horror movie  but    for a good laugh  you might want to check it out  nothing that is even close to  dawn of the dead  or even  shaun of the dead  quality  but the cheese factor is good enough  ciao
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834,just emailed a friend who s in film school about this flick  something to avoid when making a film   characters blabbering senseless  overwrought  convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing  if the film is an attempt at social realism  these verbal barrages are so over the top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent  is it the acting  or the script that is bad  or both  br    br   the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism   ravenously consuming canonical english literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated  and how is such an unattractive  unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them   i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street  despite his whining and self pitying banter   br    br   the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature  nostradamus and the book of revelations  the impending doom of mankind  in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion  is presented to a character who is oh so cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space   br    br   this flick is over scripted and over the top   a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian  philosophy  about the meaning of mankind  life  etc  it is trite  overwrought and tedious  br    br   there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film   nil by mouth  is an excellent  far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu  ditto for  in the warzone   and although the comparison is not even warranted  check out anything by peter greenaway  who far more deftly handles dialogue  wit and absurd characters and situations 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068966,gods  i haven t watched a movie this awful in a long while  maybe not since  the new guy  or various freddie prinze jr  movies  yes  it is that astoundingly awful  mira sorvino s blank and wooden acting surely must ve been inspired by freddie  the movie staging was awkward  like a play  rather  and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film   the actors had no idea what they were doing  especially sorvino  her accent was awful and her sex appeal non existent here so it was painful to see her  seducing  other characters and they  falling  for it  and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs  nonsensical  i had to turn the dvd player off  it would have been self inflicted pain to finish this film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105629,i have never seen a worse movie  br    br   it is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie  br    br   mistake 1  absolutely no connection to any of the characters  in this movie you don t bond with any of the characters because    you don t get a chance  br    br   the only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand  salish as played by clint howard  except for this unique character  the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining  br    br   mistake 2  the worst gunfight scene ever  i love gunfights  i love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house  heck i even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes  but this gunfight was weird i guess that the best way to describe it is  apathetic  i ve seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while playing the videogame  in this movie it looked and felt like the  actors  were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion  br    br   why  where s the trash talking  where s the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire  these are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad    but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity  br    br   if you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters  i recomend sam rami s evil dead series  do not see the disaster that is house of the dead  i hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893406,i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb  but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone s been fixing the score  br    br   either way it was a real disappointment  the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest  there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot   but here goes  it felt like someone had been thinking   wouldn t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane  and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff     and that s about it  the plot is thin and unoriginal  the snakes are bad cgi  but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone    the acting is poor  and all people are unbelievable stereo types  br    br   to sum it up  it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen   stay away 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103336,i began watching this movie with low expectations  as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s k  novel   a novel i never read   br    br   i m glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn t nothing close to good  but it manages to keep you interested  what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors  the movie is overlong  hasn t no  nice  shots and no scares  the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap  br    br   the only things good are that  as i said  it keeps you interested   i guess the book must be good  without using much horror cliches  br    br   my vote 4 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107604,first off i d like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10  then i d give it a  4  it s not that i m a tough critic  it s just that this movie is that bad  everything from the story  to the directing  to the editing is awful  the story is not even halfway decent to begin with  you can t expect much since it is based on a video game  something i was not aware of going into the movie  but the directing and editing made it even worse  the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones  some  like a quick sex scene in the middle  don t even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don t show any feelings toward each other  you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you d still be disappointed  honestly  if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money  and if you don t pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life  so do yourself a favor and don t watch it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071198,   spoilers       spoilers    continued    br    br   from here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself  first we meet a rogue program with the indication we re gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like  we get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage  two  ghosts  that serve no real purpose and have no character what so ever and a bunch of henchmen  someone s told me they re vampires  straight out of blade 2   but they re so undefined i didn t realise  br    br   the funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the oracle  only for far longer and far far worse  he has a simple point about cause and effect  makes it  then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid  his final line before walking off is comparable to storm s  do you know what happens to a toad     line in x men in levels of utter bland baddness  the chocolate cake is such a lazy  pathetic cliche and monica bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her  br    br   and then we get another kung fu fight    why  neo is  allegedly  the one  he can do anything  he has the ultimate power and what does he use it for  kung bloody fu all the time  and while he can stop 1000 bullets  he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen  vampires    i wanted to see mind blowing powers  i wanted to see him do the wildest  craziest most insane s    to people because he can do anything  i got the same as before without the  wow   br    br   the fabled car chase  that can t be bad  well    no  it s not  it s just not what we ve been tyold it was going to be  all the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer  every one  so all possibly wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with  guess what  a kung fu fight    ok  it s not neo  but you d have thought he d have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the matrix  at least taught them something  it s not hard  br    br    hey  morpheus  don t worry about what happens to you in the matrix  it s not real  as long as you understand that nothing s real then nothing can really harm you   br    br   there you go  simple  br    br   ok  so the chase is not bad  it s never boring and it doesn t seem like 16 minutes  it s just so underwhelming  and still  it gets worse  br    br   the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable  they have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews  they then only show it sporadically between morpheus s over long  super preachy  monologue  to make it worse  they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is  you know basically  but you don t know who s doing what  when  so when one crew goes down you just don t care and you don t know how this is going to affect what goes on  br    br   i ll sum it up though  it happens so trinity can get back into the matrix to setup the end  that s the only reason it happens  which raises the question  why did they need to send 6 people originally  trinity gets in in five minutes by herself  br    br   neo s journey to the centre of the matrix  so to speak  is handled equally lazily  ooohhh    he runs into another 100 agent smiths    woooooo    that must ve taken a lot of thought  only now they re in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment  man  what a grand finale    br    br   and then the architect    br    br   remember everything i said was bad about the oracle and the foreign guy  add them together and double it  that s how truly appalling the architect is  the only reasonable potential of him is he s about to set up the cliffhanging climax  br    br   and then he blows it  br    br   let s look at the options he gives neo  choose one door and all humanity dies  except 27      choose the other and all humanity dies    considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn t really give it s hero one  if he had a choice of save humanity and the missus dies or save the missus and kill humanity there s the potnetial for inner torment and tension  also  with trinity being mid fall  the potential of a real cliffhanger that would ve made seeing the third more essential  but no  he has save no one or save the missus  br    br   now  the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end  the year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid jar jar was they didn t notice that the very end of the matrix made him look him steven hawking   the oracle told me i d fall in love with the one  and i love you      come on     how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was  br    br   so  what do the wachowski s do in the sequel  well  they make the ending of the original look better  how  well  by doing almost exactly the same thing again  only swapping characters  only so much worse i think my f a and r keys would be worn out if i kept writing far before i got to worse  br    br   and the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger  it s a reminder  br    br   basically  this film is just bad  i really didn t want it to be bad  but it is  bad in just so many ways  and to make matters worse  this isn t a film with not enough budget  it s not a film with too short a schedule  it s not a film that s been rushed out  it s not a film where too much influence has come from the outside  this is exactly the film

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117894,one would think  as i did   that with steve martin  goldie hawn  and john cleese  a movie should be  at the very least  decent  these stars  especially martin and cleese  have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time  br    br   well  apparently i was grossly mistaken  this is single handedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny  it pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across  based solely on the big names  i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film  but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever  br    br   normally  both with movies and in life  i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations  but with this film  it s hard not to let loose  i can count on one hand  perhaps even two or three fingers  major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this  this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made  br    br   i tried to enjoy this   i really did  but the out of towners ultimately fails miserably  if you really want time efficient entertainment  just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet  just please don t watch this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176579,anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal  the author of the novel and screenplay  to air her prejudices  grievances and general antipathy towards the english  the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul  br    br   the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight  violent  foul mouthed  promiscuous  engaging in child neglect  stupid  uneducated  racist  ugly  eating poor food  and dim witted    tellingly  only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be  redeemed  at the end of the film  br    br   by contrast  the indian family are beautiful  clever  educated  can speak many languages  are caring and loving parents  and grammar school fodder  the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all  had it been the other way round  an english family in an indian community depicted this way  the film would have been seen as racist  br    br   there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead  i thought it would lodge in my hairline  first  the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration    undertext  the english are dirty and promiscuous    and the men    undertext  english women are prostitutes  second  the meal with anita where neema s family lie to her about cutlery    undertext  the english are so stupid  you can make them do anything  br    br   but the underlying contempt towards anything english    even english weddings are an object of scorn    is evident all the way through the film  the character of anita was drawn so appallingly    almost the fallen woman trope    that i finished the film feeling angry  br    br   this is not a  bend it like beckham  where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community  and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together  instead  anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable  as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste  and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film s  other  community  the english  br    br   i felt anita and me is a hate filled  grievance based piece of work  on that basis  the bbc should not have funded its production 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231775,the only thing great about the movie is its title  in this case   snake on a plane  is example of not judging the book by its cover  the title says nothing about the movie  when i went to the theater  i wasn t expecting citizen kane  i was expecting independence day  a movie that s pure popcorn fun  but instead  i got that horrible roy liotta movie called   turbulence  yes  this is how bad soap is  the only thing make soap better is its title  and it s not even the apporiate title for the movie  the wasn t even a glimpse of  snake  or  plane  40 minutes into the movie  what a false advertising  if it wasn t for its title  soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie  and the r rating  it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time  the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r  all of the violence are kept pg 13 level  you know what s really r rated  the r rated superstar edge  see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434964,i was really looking forward to watching this  being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress  the beginning was interesting  i liked the relationship between the two stars  it then quickly jumps to the main plot  which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped  they then decide to go for some revenge  sounds good  right  well  it s not  the story gets boring and side tracked  and certain things get really weird  i won t give out any details  but things happen that i  for one  have no desire to see  i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt  and i really wanted to like this one  it just didn t work out  i give it a 3 out of 10  mainly for the acting 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443527,now i don t hate cheap movies  i just don t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad s camcorder  if i rent a movie  i want it to be a movie  not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv   tapes  br    br   maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great  and it wasn t  maybe i hate it because it s cheap  has the dumbest plot ever  the most unrealistic characters ever and the really  really  really worst showdown in the history of films ever  even tom savini can t save this  br    br   seriously  this one is a complete waste of time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075357,  some spoilers   br    br   this movie is sometimes subtitled  life everlasting   that s often taken as reference to the final scene  but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send off  br    br   there s a  hey kids  let s put on a show air  about this telemovie  which can be endearing in spots  some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances  co writer  co producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows  as well as real baltimore personages  br    br   that s on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television s show varied casts  your old favorites as well as later non favorites  br    br   there was always a tug of war pitting quality conscious executive producer barry levinson  fontana  james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc execs  who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like  nash bridges   which regularly beat  homicide  in the ratings  the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form  and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it  br    br   unfortunately for this movie  fontana  co writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel  they took the most ludicrous story are from the series  topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line  and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members  br    br   briefly  some time has passed since the last episode of the show  the former heart of baltimore s homicide unit  yaphet kotto as lt  al giardello  is now a kurt schmoke like candidate for mayor  and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance  but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn  br    br   the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardello s son mike  a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere  esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series  but the question for viewers always was  is mike that uncomfortable as gee s son  or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role  br    br   to be fair  esposito doesn t get a chance to play out the main story without interruption  that s because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show s loyal voters  br    br   an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted  and then seemed to actually take place  on the internet  after some red herrings  the detectives arrested a repellent suspect  but zaljko ivanek s harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time  and the suspect was released  only to be murdered later  br    br   let s summarize  he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasn t the most sensational case of his career  because the mayor  the attorney general  the governor  the entire maryland legislature  the u s  attorney general  nbc  court tv  the bbc  ap  reuters  people  the sun  the washington post  the new york times  the la times  time magazine  the times of london  the economist  the johannesburg mail and guardian  l osservatore romano  le figaro  paris match  l equipe and computer world weren t calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case  br    br   nevertheless  the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out  there s quite an array of talent on display  unfortunately  with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out  some of them are merely on display  br    br   two of the strongest actors  clark johnson and melissa leo  are criminally underused  while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials  the writers do seem to satirize this  presenting jason priestley as the latest big deal detective  on the other hand  they give easy come  easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene  br    br   there s some other sly casting  with actual lt  gary d addario  the center of the book that gave rise to the show  playing another detective  guests drop in from other shows  like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless  miss sally  from the children s show beloved by the inmates on fontana s  oz   dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself   br    br   even when entertaining  though  these guests can be distracting  ed begley jr  actually advances the story in his brief appearance  playing dr  victor ehrlich from fontana s  st  elsewhere   he s still a vivid character  and fits in a hospital setting  then you remember  didn t st  elegius turn out to be an autistic boy s fantasy  br    br   the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy  this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series  that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis  who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on  oz   the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news  that is  plot points for latecomers  br    br   although she s so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways  lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito  he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues  perhaps those two should have done a spin off  br    br   as the movie winds down  the cream of the cast rises to the top  although they are saddled with a loser script  andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it  their performances remind viewers what made homicide  for considerable stretches  the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever  br    br   it s fun to watch top pros do their stuff  it s just a shame this movie doesn t give them more of a chance  die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway  but you can live without it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317676,i usually like comedy movies  i really enjoy them  but i don t really get the point of  envy   i mean  it has a dull content topic  and it s not really funny  br    br   although the acting is generally good  it s not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting  stiller and black don t show all their talent in this movie  br    br   so  if you re about to rent a comedy  i suggest you definitely don t go for this one  unless you want to get bored  and i can see i m not the only one with this opinion  because even jack black apologized for it  take a look at trivia  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050599,this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent  i ve lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people don t have a southern accent here  this movie is about a guy who does meth and i don t know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about  it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it s really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar  i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug  the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line  i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don t want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day  the movie is just wrong in all directions  i would suggest  the basketball diaries  if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116756,i rented this movie last week  i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it  so it seemed promising  and it was  until justin timberlake came on scene  he is a really bad actor and shouldn t be allowed to make a movie ever again  i mean  he is one of the most boring  uninspired actors i ve ever seen  he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever  why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack  i think matt damon would have been a better choice  br    br   kevin spacey was another big disappointment  his character is so dull  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en  it might sound cool  but believe me  it s not  br    br   now  dylan mcdermott s acting is very good  it s about one of the very few good things about this movie  he is just inspired  br    br   morgan freeman is good but nothing special  he has some really cool lines though  br    br   about the story  although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good  i was expecting a big twist when lazerov  dylan mcdermott  was killed  but nothing really happened 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086336,i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive dvd video laserdisc collection  so luckily i didn t personally have to pay for it  i had an inkling that it would be a bad film  but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldn t play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies  and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad  br    br   solar crisis is bad  but it doesn t reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at  br    br   anyway  the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it  in order to counter act this imminent threat  humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb  which the opening describes as  the biggest explosive ever   into the sun  which through some convoluted sci fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle  leaving earth unharmed  br    br   never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek  even with an ensemble cast  charlton heston  peter boyle  and jack palance   solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity  thanks to a plot that starts simple  yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on  br    br   the crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character  played by boyle  who insists on sabotaging the mission  through means that are never explained  he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crew s genetically engineered scientist  played by female lead annabel schofield  why is he sabotaging the mission  because by his moronic viewpoint  he believes the flare won t happen and that when it doesn t  he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market  in effect  you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable  br    br   the film s plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly  in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline  i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention  but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages  and i would only succeed in losing your interest  but then again  you would probably get the same effect from watching the film  br    br   anyway  the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue  imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed sci fi jargon back and forth at each other  yes  i know  they already do that  but imagine if that s all they did  and that they used said jargon to set up vague and near nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement  tension  or interest in the viewer whatsoever  br    br   this is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zero g environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding  the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion  but doesn t bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs  nor why he can t really escape  in totality  you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable  br    br   then we have several scenes where dramatic build up leads to nothing  jack palance s performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero  don t ask  around the desert  before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits  on his death bed  palance finally tells our boy hero his last name  while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball   which he kept quiet about before  colonel travis j  richards  the boy repeats it quietly after he expires  giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film  perhaps charlton heston s grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated  something  anything  br    br   nope  sorry  any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic  failed attempts at creating drama for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palance s career  just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred  br    br   completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain s spell  a climax which features another of the film s considerably well done visual effects sequences that  even for the visibly elaborate care put into them  still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is  the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget  tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle  heston  and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over acting  br    br   grade  d 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384507,really  i can t believe that i spent  5 on this movie  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn t be that bad  it had zombies in it right  was i wrong  to be honest the movie had it s moments   i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that  buyer beware   unless you are into masochism 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390468,this is just a bad movie  with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better  it almost were  with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek  hero fighting almost like jackie chan  battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger     music almost like in  say  conan    etc  almost  but in the end it s just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it  maybe apart of john rhys davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before mentioned crouching tiger    i am really ashamed of poor old john  he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better  so as you   so if you still have a chance just watch something else 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102722,there s only one thing i m going to say about cat in the hat   as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks   i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren t exactly kid appropriate  oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying   as for the plot i completely forgot  who cares it sucked anyway  i m not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded  but so what it was annoying  don t see it it belongs in the bottom 100                               the jokes are so unkiddy it s funny
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081793,currently  this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made  which is exactly why i rented it from netflix  however  i am saddened to report that the film  while bad  is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list  i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn t meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list  br    br   the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon  by the way  they are married in real life as well   he s a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly  hallmark of a bad film  and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us  both of which are not true at all  br    br   oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn t even bother going to the hospital   the first thing on anyone s mind  especially a doctor  is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he s having seizures  yet he still isn t interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history    br    br   after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it s too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it s totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife  who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain  refuses to believe he s dangerous  even after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road    br    br   now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops bat like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat like  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a 1  br    br   in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss  and mcandrew s belief that this film would somehow help their careers  though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974  br    br   overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either  br    br   note  for some reason  imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it s alive and it s two sequels of the web page for the bat people  while the bat people has been seen with the title  it s alive   the two movies are not at all related  it s easy to understand the mistake  especially since they both came out in 1974  but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074776,as a casual listener of the rolling stones  i thought this might be interesting  not so  as this film is very  of its age   in the 1960 s  to me  someone born in the 1980 s  this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap  but i am sure this film was not made for me  but people who were active during th  60 s  i expected drugs galore with th stones  i was disappointed  it actually showed real life  hard work in the studio  so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film  i have not seen any of the directors other films  but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing  sort of  amatuerish  which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash  badly directed  tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value  my only good opinion of this is that i didn t waste money on it  it came free with a sunday paper 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122223,the first movie is pretty good  this one is pretty bad  br    br   recycles a lot of footage  including the opening credits and end title  from criminally insane  the new footage  shot on video  really sticks out as poorly done  scenes lack proper lighting  the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible  there s even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on  br    br   like all bad sequels  it basically just repeats the story of the first one  ethel kills everybody who shares her living space  often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants  br    br   at least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one  which also includes the same director s film satan s black wedding  too bad it doesn t include the death nurse movies though 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424095,spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen  he is the critic s darling because he supposedly makes films with a  message  or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different  br    br   summer of sam does not even do that well  the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone  and so is the narrative  the plot is a lot like  do the right thing   the portrayal of  guidos  or for the pc set italian americans  of which i happen to be one  is straight out of eddie murphy s raw  only eddie murphy s impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller african american is much  much more believable than the cartoonish  broad italian caricatures shown here  the john leguizamo character being a possible exception   br    br   is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up  as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach  i could already see him being accused of being the killer  this character had the most integrity in the whole film so  of course  lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd  what a white bearded clique   br    br   someone please  please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants  so  maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won t have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i won t have to see critics  some of them whom i respect  ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105629,this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie  the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory  however  everything else sucks  the director  emmanuel  is quite incompetent at film making  he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever  br    br     a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film  i don t know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn t  it was stupid  random shots of the trailer the main character lived in  random buildings  random pan shots of buildings  random cat which walks away  wtf  and clouds  lots of gloomy dark clouds  br    br     he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot  ex  guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him  instead of just one shot  he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy  and hip  and smart  stupid  br    br   the acting is horrible but it s what makes the movie so funny  and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time  and some of the deaths could have been better  you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope  a simple corncob in the ear   the love interest was hot  voluptuous  which is why this movie gets a 2 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783608,what a terrible movie  rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too  don t be fooled by the positive comments  it wasn t scary  it wasn t funny  it wasn t clever  it won t even hold your attention  i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap fest  the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times  after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained  the dialogue was terrible  must be a translation thing  another negative that stood out was the idiot americans  3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character  intelligence and judgment  now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10  the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216196,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real  the special effects of this movie are very good  i have seen most of this movie  since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months  i must admit  i may have missed a few scenes  but i m usually drawn into movies  and have seen some scenes more than once  but every time i see some of  hollow man   i feel depressed  almost like a  film noir   i m not sure why  perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil  and there s disappointment in that  but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes  regardless  i can recommend this movie for excitement  although some parts move slowly   but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14  perhaps 12  if they are mature  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083189,they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat  in the first cruel intentions  we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do  there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel  it s actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me  it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f words  and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn t explain anything  the writing was just terrible  another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original  such as  down boy   or the kissing scene  and a few others i can t remember  i was not impressed at all by robin s acting  but amy did a great job  that s about the only thing that reconciled this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804551,like most comments i saw this film under the name of the witching which is the reissue title  apparently necromancy which is the original is better but i doubt it  br    br   most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad  in many ways i think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value  but don t be fooled  there s only 3 scenes with nudity and it s of the people standing around variety  no diabolique rumpy pumpy involved  br    br   this movie is so inherently awful it s difficult to know what to criticise first  the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker  at least troma is tongue in cheek though  this is straight faced boredom personified  the acting is variable with pamela franklin  flora the possessed kid in the innocents would you believe   the worst with her high pitched screechy voice  welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque  the other female lead has a creepy face so i don t know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film  and the doctor is pretty bad too  he also looks worringly like gene wilder  br    br   it is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy  this is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that  only the lighting is ok  the sound is also dreadful and it s difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up  the  ghost  mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs  br    br   really this film  the witching at least  is only for the unwary  it can t have many sane fans as it s pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind numbingly dull   br    br   the best bit was when the credits rolled   enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314063,words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is  i wish it were  so bad it s good   but it s not  it s just dull  lifeless  and boring  it s so bad i couldn t even laugh at it  br    br   in response to other posters  anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie  the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead  they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother  br    br   the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker  the complete opposite of anne marie   attractive  this girl is tall and willowy  and can act  although you can tell she s holding back  br    br   all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark  i ve seen less wood in a rain forest  but he s still better than kelly  why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly   there isn t one  kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime  i know how he felt stepping in the poo  it s how i felt after watching his movie  br    br   yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store  this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  you ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287535,me neither  but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful  which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time  there s nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie  and my name is modesty  whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level  it s full of b actors but isn t any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously  it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing up drama  flashback style  the beautiful alexandra staden  smothered beyond recognition under makeup  more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise  i m not one of those die hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious  graphic novels  to be pitch perfect   in fact i ve never even read modesty blaise   all i wanted was a decent movie to watch  but this wasn t it  the film feels half finished  with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot  it also takes its audience for idiots  explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago  i guess they think we all have alzheimers   br    br   now i love a good b movie   what s better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a calzone    and  modesty  is directed by none other than scott spiegel  who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from dusk till dawn 2  texas blood money  i loved from dusk till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad b movie should bring to the table   nudity  gore  guns  you name it   modesty  is just dull  the flashback concerning modesty s life isn t interesting  the acting isn t bad enough to be laughed at  in fact  i kinda liked nikolaj coaster waldau s  hey buddy  pseudonyms are your friends   performance as the baddie  br    br   so overall it s just lame  weak  uninspired  call it what you will  don t watch anything because tarantino presents it  people  this is just a very forgettable  half hearted thriller  and it never tries to be more than that  allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun  seriously  even i m cringing   my name is modesty  a modesty waste of time   4 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832903,i just saw the movie in theater  the movie has very few good points to talk about  kareena s beauty and a couple of songs may be  thats it  the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas  anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi final    br    br   but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes  now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood  but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real  but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time  they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie  now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people  but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work  all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded  at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar  this is height of stupidity  audience is not paying to watch such stupidity  i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies  they cant make it  the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi   the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me  does these people see their movie after completion  can t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it  i just want to go back to amitabh s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes  the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes   br    br   this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors  please don t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422909,i don t think this movie was rated correctly  i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r  i would not recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18  whatever the r limit is  br    br   why  it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women  i don t know about you  but that s not something for little children to be watching  true  it might be the traditional  clothing style  of the african     indians  but    i think partial nudity should give a movie an r rating  br    br   i haven t seen the movie recently  but i guess otherwise  it was alright 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167456,i liked boyle s performance  but that s about the only positive thing i can say  everything was overdone to the point of absurdity  most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9 year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded  stone hearted cop  or an ultra evil villain  the raspy voice overs seemed amateurish to me  i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music  and what s with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff  it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story  cox added a lot of things  in fact  that he apparently thought would be really cool  but had nothing to do with the story  that s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges  stories so good is his minimalism    they are tightly bound  with no superfluous details  this movie is just the opposite  i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung  or thereabouts  i wasted  4 renting this  but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369,watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time  because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans  it s a mercy that anthony quinn couldn t persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey  br    br   but it is filled with amusement value  since yul brynner has hair  lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent  and the rest of the big names strut about in comic book fashion 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907, sundown the vampire in retreat  is a rubbish the acting is terrible the atmosphere is non existent and the characters are uninteresting the only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the imdb users gave it a 10 this is really horrifying no gore no suspense no violence nothing bruce cambell  the evil dead   intruder  is completely wasted the supporting cast is also terrible yes some people may like this picture especially a mainstream society but hard core horror fans or gore hounds won t enjoy this piece of crap personally i hate horror comedies i prefer watching serious horror movies like  cannibal holocaust  or  last house on the left  in my opinion a real horror movie is supposed to be scary excessively bloody and disturbing without stupid humour which usually ruins the whole concept this one isn t scary isn t gory isn t even funny as a comedy so don t waste your precious time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350091,having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time  it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience  i have to say that while i agree films don t have to make sense to be enjoyable  see mulholland drive  they still have to engage you with the characters  now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch s opus  i have to say i couldn t give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world   br    br   also  while so many people seem to try and say you didn t enjoy because you didn t get it i would have to disagree   i didn t enjoy because i was bored  i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help  call it clever if you will   i think it s repetitious  br    br   however  my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question   there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw  just music over black  did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr s pretentiousness  or  did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421199,i just watched this movie  in one word  sucky  the story is bad  the acting is  if possible  even worse  the movie has one or two nice moments  but thats it and having those two small good moments  doesn t make up for anything in between  before or after those moments  a montrocity of a movie  not even worth watching on tv   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312528,the director  outfitted in chains and leather  warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an  experiental  film  experimental  leave the video camera on the back seat of the car  let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight  a meandering pastiche road show manqu  that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place  the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater  i would have left  too  but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end  by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably  tepid applause  pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product  avoid this film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085112,i have watched anime but i m not a die hard fan  and i don t read manga  i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background  i have seen  st  john s wort   and although it isn t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination  it made me pick up  shinobi   especially since everyone seems to love it  br    br   well  i watched it this afternoon  and fought very hard to keep watching  yes  it s very beautiful   the slow motion water scenes  the autumn leaves on the trees  even the cgi eye flicker   majestic  i liked the hawk  the costumes  even some of the fight scenes  but overall this was dull as dirt  br    br   it seemed as if someone took  romeo and juliet    the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers   and threw in some  x men  for good measure  two of the characters split wolverine s powers   the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey haired guy had his ability to heal himself  then you have the girl who has a poison kiss   that s poison ivy  from batman   why do they give these women such dumb powers  poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death  man  that s some great power for you  and the other girl  can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands  the other woman  one of the star crossed lovers  has the power of a hypnotic stare  wow  br    br   i sort of made it to the end of the film  by fast forwarding it  and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected  some people are comparing this to  house of flying daggers  and  hero   don t make that mistake  they may share similar endings  but that s where the similarities end   shinobi  is made by an amateur   the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker  br    br   i would say avoid this film unless you re 12 to 18 years old 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482870,my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video  although it had great actors actresses  there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest  plus it just wasn t that interesting  dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable  i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn s last movies  i ll always love john ritter best in slapstick  he was just too pathetic here 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071198,this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified  of course there probably wouldn t be an x files if this show hadn t prepped this audience for it so well  darren mcgavin is not exactly the super heroic type but he is a plausible enough  guy to deliver heroic deeds  check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents  here he is the main attraction  there doesn t seem to be a girlfriend or wife who s a distraction  in fact there isn t a whole lot of sex appeal to the show  something i m noticing as well is that the pacing isn t really suspenseful in a typical way  there s a lot of throwaway humor to this show  sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax  there s a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style  not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio comic tone 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096511,you don t expect much from a prc picture  and with rare exceptions  mainly from edgar g  ulmer and a few by joseph h  lewis or lew landers  that s exactly what you get  not much  this  epic  about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isn t much different  the script  by longtime prc hacks arthur st  claire and sherman lowe  is trite  laughable  full of unfunny  wisecracks  and plot holes the size of outer mongolia  the direction  by longtime prc no budget specialist al herman  is semi comatose at best  the performances  though  except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king  aren t really half bad  veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film  he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up  he s got great comic timing  charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time  duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik  despite his spanish accent  and veteran bad guy george j  lewis as renaldo s arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy  even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes  joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch  and she and renaldo have great chemistry together  although  like the rest of the cast  she has none at all with king  h b  warner  whose career stretched back to the silent era  lends a shred of dignity to the low rent proceedings  even though he blows his lines several times and  prc being prc  they weren t cut out  there s a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big budget silent movie with a similar arab theme  although i have no idea which one it is  and  prc being prc  no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous  i ve seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious  br    br    a yank in libya  isn t very good  of course  well  ok  it stinks  but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime  i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor director albert brooks and super dave osborne  but had never actually seen him in anything before  it was worth watching this tenth rate prc  extravaganza  just to see him in action  otherwise  forget it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845463,now don t get me wrong  if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind  who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture  if you need a healthy dose of all the solid  sound reasons why religion has outlived it s usefulness then turn to sagan or dawkins  not bill maher for god s    sake  that s a good point in and of itself  maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society  art and science is rooted in it  br    br   in this film  he relies heavily on his keenly honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise  unfortunately  his intellect isn t up to the task  br    br   maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box  as an example  he responds to an interviewee s  and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all  ambushees   assertion that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan  no  it s not  followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject s naivety  a device nauseatingly overused in this film   the problem is that the person was correct and maher dead wrong in his assertion that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically  suspect gospels  i guess mr  maher has never read the contemporary historian josephus  br    br   but the masses will flock to this pseudo documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore  and they will loudly bray and guffaw  they certainly did at my showing   br    br   it s doubly telling  however  that the loudest and most mule like braying occurred during the approximately 70  of the running time that the film devoted to it s anti christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10  devoted to criticizing the self described religion of peace  hmmm  either criticism of islam is off limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh  very telling  either way  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404802,being a big fan of the  other  planet of the apes films  i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton  once again  he doesn t fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction  even the ape makeup looks second rate  which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity  mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor  as if boogie nights wasn t proof enough   i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter  no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn t possibly have been the cliche ridden screenplay  i rented this dvd on a special  1 night and i still feel ripped off 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329334,there are two kinds of characters on the shield  people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing  and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes  and everyone s only hope  more than any other show  the shield is about hypocrisy and self delusion  unfortunately  the hypocrites and self deluders are the shows heroes  and as such have the typical genre fiction heroes  improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again  making fools out of all of their peers  br    br   the show boasts excellent camera work  the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb  it really is a work of art to see  unfortunately the story is a cartoony  overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence  rape  and lies  br    br   the hero  who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme  is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character  always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds  anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes   automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show  always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice  and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications  if another cop detects something wrong with something he s doing  and someone gets hurt because of his actions  he always blames the suspicious cop  regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause  every time  br    br   like 24  this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season  boring  unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody  perverted chunks of meat that are the characters  corrupt acts and the inevitable cover ups  br    br   most disappointing though  is the writers  hubris as they try to change the viewers  sympathies back and forth  to and away form the characters on whims  sometimes  they want us to see shane as the enemy  sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul  sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous  sexual dynamo  sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold  sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel  then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane  that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic  br    br   none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want  once they ve shown these characters ruin other people s lives for their own ends  that s it  it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth  but then  it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station  right under everyone s noses

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304711,i ve never been to paris  but after seeing  paris  je t aime  i m crazy to visit this city  i ve been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs  i kinda expected to be touched by this film  to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away  but  lo and behold  i regret the time and money i spent with it  there are no love stories between people or a person and the city  there s a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn t work out fine  maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city  where it s said to have thousands of people living on their own  can t you find love in new york 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317676,this may have been based on historical events  and we know that the makers of this tv docu drama took liberties to make it more dramatic   i can live with that   but it was just so badly done  i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid air crisis how calm everyone seemed  surely someone would have panicked  and what a smooth flight  no passenger discomfort apparent   come on  not sure about the regulations  nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems ott nonsense  but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing  common sense tells me this is not a good idea  the shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake  in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby  in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was  escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors  yet nobody appeared to exit from the front  even though the drop was much less  the captain went back into the plane after the landing   why  this was never explained  we know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel  but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks  and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger  yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely  and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible  as i am sure i would have done  there were just too many inconsistencies  errors and faked action in this  i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time  and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed  it had the potential to be quite thrilling  but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed  and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really  and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing  but no real danger    the reality of course being somewhat different 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367457,okay  i remember watching the first one  and boy did it suck  after watching it  i just laughed it off and told myself   oh boy  just another low budget b movie  i ll never see a part 2 to this one   then  about 1 1 2 years later  there came part two  it sucked even more  but  i just laughed it off again and said   there s no way i m ever gonna see a part 3 to this one   then  about 1 2 a year later  part 3 came out  i was stupid enough to rent it and boy  i just snapped after watching it  god  i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days  just save yourself  7 50 and don t rent the whole series  trust me  it s worth every penny

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082363,this film is awful  give me the dentist anytime  can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film  i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this  the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting  better plot  more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid  don t even watch it if you re drunk 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453671,to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite  i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn t mean it is a terrorist thing  it also show s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype  by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn t mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time  like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like  blow up  or yaser saying we ll blow away the competition  and people took it the wrong way  being a muslim i know that stuff like this don t usually happen  but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq  its not right things are not like that  people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act  i am glad a show like this came on the air  there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair  but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117589,first of all  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema  which is because  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline  this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos  as the director and marketing ads imply  in my mere opinion  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant  br    br   however  the acting is near perfect  in fact  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked  talent  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job  even the less experienced ones   like janset  at least  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation   just because he knows well how to choose the cast  other than that  he is just a media monkey  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent  come on  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women  and just because media boasts off  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema  just close your ears and o something real artistic  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work  hope  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach  br    br   in short  pros   good acting  hot women  just kidding      cons  each and every single thing  other than the cast
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067,pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult  who fights them sixteen years later  the man has a child with one of the other cultists  who during a raid by the police is hidden away  and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river  the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town  it s hard to keep track of who characters are  or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place  the leader gets paroled sixteen years later  i got that from the box   i missed the amount of time in the movie   nobody is made to look any older  not noticeably  anyway  br    br   one murder is done with a large circular logging saw  others are done with knives or a crossbow  i never heard the title character s name mentioned in the movie  but he s the one who overacts the most  hooting and hollering  br    br   the movie is patched together pretty poorly  with voice over helping  not much  to explain what is going on  some of the sound effects were pretty bad  a man is getting punched  and we hear the sound of a whip cracking  a woman fires a gun  and we don t hear it fire  but hear a ricochet instead  it doesn t seem to have been done for comical effect 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080595,this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie making  it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable  from the unrealistic to the ludicrous  br    br   the unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two british soldiers and a hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent indians  in the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush  in the british army  a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt  and if you get past that  he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand  the indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable   there are hundreds of them but they can t hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers  of course not  at one point we see the british soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents  who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush   one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage  after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot  he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy   hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back  the water boy bravely blows a bugle  which comes from nowhere  to sound the alarm   this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys  and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks   instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do  this scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches  if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy  they should have hired keaton and done it better 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069311,this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past  let the future viewer be forewarned that  art heist  doesn t add anything to the genre  director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the film  br    br   william baldwin keeps reappearing in films  and frankly  one wonders if he has a great agent  or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks  complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies  the only good movie in which he has appeared  is  the squid and the whale   in which he only speaks two  or three lines  ellen pompeo  his leading lady  doesn t fare much better  there is no chemistry between ms  pompeo and mr  baldwin  br    br   a movie to be seen at the viewer s own risk 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot  i d like to mention a few points about this film  there may be spoilers here  i don t care enough to filter them out  br    br     given the film s low budget  the creature design was quite good  it s actually nice to see a direct to video horror film that s not slathered with awful cgi  unfortunately the digital film quality s quite grainy in places  and it s most noticeable in the well lit white halls of the asylum  br    br     ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film  to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time  i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia  but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established  as is  it merely seems amateurish  br    br     plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable  i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists  nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil trumps good development would surface at the end  br    br     this may seem like quibbling  but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense  first of all  regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest induced  why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies  why wasn t a plot point made of these impressive qualifications  or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion  what s the background  what s supposed to make us care about anyone in this  and just as importantly  who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place  see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it  and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency  this film didn t even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt  br    br   bottom line  see the wicker man instead 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995035,coyote ugly might have been much more effective if the film makers had made it an r rated guilty pleasure exploitation film  with plenty of nudity   but since the pg 13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days  we end up with a movie like this  a pg 13  tease  flick that isn t allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone  br    br   the script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens  the acting is adequate  but the characters are so paper thin that nothing could be done with them  there were also a lot of points where it seemed like i was watching a music video rather than a movie  br    br   the film s only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads  we get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits     but only so much could be shown due to the pg 13 constraints  there s plenty of cleavage and toned  heaving bodies doing some well choreographed dance numbers  but there s no nudity or sex to speak of  tyra banks  she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age  is also in the movie for a very small amount of time  sexy newcomer piper perabo is also very easy on the eyes  and she has a killer smile  and shows some genuine acting potential  br    br   the only people i could see this movie appealing to is pre pubescent boys who aren t allowed to watch r rated movies yet  that audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect  but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated  br    br   rating  the movie 1 the women 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791304,i cannot believe that this movie was ever created  i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse  the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup  the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes  finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation  the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished  again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie  also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all  it is never explained 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505,going down as the most expensive film in finnish history  to date   dark floors  is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of  floors   ironically enough  in an abandoned hospital  in which our protagonists are trapped  lead by an autistic daughter and her father  himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter  make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses  accompanied by a security guard  a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned  but they are not alone  directed by finnish  born pete riski  more known for his television work   dark floors  is filmed in english  using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland s arguably most famous group  lordi   2006 eurovision song contest winners  as themselves  i e  in their on stage monstrous costumes  as the films antagonists  yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most  in convincing the audience  br    br   any film that has their lead character use the phrase  it s too quiet  is already headed down a dubious path  and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention  for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clich s alongside and worst of all  anything that is interestingly original isn t fleshed out enough for it to resonate  the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire  however  there isn t enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear  the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous  as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black  but i don t think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening  also  the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch  a concept not often used in the horror genre  but the characters don t confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact  they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience  these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste  as if the director and or mr lordi  who had many of the ideas used within the film  had these thoughts  but couldn t agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point   br    br   yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy  yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for  too much is clich d  too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous  while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley  the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films  we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest  accompanying the  couple  we have the traditional token black man as a hard nosed security guard  with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm  and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself  worst of all though  unfortunately  is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits  but not for them appearing as themselves  what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear   the shining  is scary because it s a member of your own family hounding you  in  dawn of the dead  it s our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess  in  alien  the fear is explained  the creature is rationalised and in  dark floors  there is none of that  perhaps it s unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it s aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear  without a build up of any atmosphere  lordi  just aren t scary  br    br   it s infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well  you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as  hollywood  churns out  much in the similar way that george a romero started out  but it doesn t always materialise  i enjoyed the film and didn t feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through  but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously  emotionally or critically  i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point  but it fades out into nothingness  why did it happen  what does it mean  will they go through this all again  without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty  was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence  had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under  who knows  and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care   dark floors  is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi  who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas  it s one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174336,this film is absolutely awful  but nevertheless  it can be hilarious at times  although this humor is entirely unintentional  br    br   the plot was beyond ridiculous  i don t even think a 2 year old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film makers tried to slap together into a story  however  on the positive side  some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor  for example   wow  lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard   it gets worse  and even funnier   but i ll spare you  br    br   the acting is generally laughable  most of the kids  roles are sort of cute  but not very believable  on the other hand  annie is pretty awful all around  the adults don t take their roles seriously at all  but this is largely a good thing  if they d tried to be believable  the film would ve been even worse  which is difficult to imagine  br    br   once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie  there are actually a few standout moments of almost not crappiness  the scene where lady hogbottom s son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious  though it s an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police  the butler character  while very minor  is a ray of sunlight that almost  but never quite pierces through the gloom  br    br   watching this movie actually caused me physical pain  nevertheless  there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally  judged on its good parts alone  the movie would be about a 5  unfortunately  the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1  thus  i give it a 3  br    br   that s being pretty generous  i d say 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404325,the film starts with a manager  nicholas bell  giving welcome investors  robert carradine  to primal park   a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna  like  jurassik park   and some scientists resurrect one of nature s most fearsome predators  the sabretooth tiger or smilodon   scientific ambition turns deadly  however  and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey   the human visitors   tourists and scientific meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre historical animals which are deadlier and bigger   in addition   a security agent  stacy haiduk  and her mate  brian wimmer  fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons  the sabretooths  themselves   of course  are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing  the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature s most fearsome predators  furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims  br    br   the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading  hair raising chills full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring  the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy  middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts  running bound and leaps or dangling over walls   and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene  no for small kids by realistic gory and violent attack scenes   other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following    sabretooth 2002  by james r hickox with vanessa angel  david keith and john rhys davies and the much better  10 000 bc 2006   by roland emmerich with with steven strait  cliff curtis and camilla belle  this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films  miller is an australian director usually working for television  tidal wave  journey to the center of the earth  and many others  and occasionally for cinema   the man from snowy river  zeus and roxanne robinson crusoe    rating   below average  bottom of barrel 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473553,even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific  it s hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this  with a string of anti military anti war movies already being destroyed at the box office  it s almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script  br    br   at first  it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusack s  all over again  but only about 90 seconds into the movie  it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelove  br    br   i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one  i have to say that i don t know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it  cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide  tom cruise was never close to being this far gone  not even close 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397535,this has to be  by far  the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years  when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films  and he was a pretty fair actor  wrong  no one should waste their time on this film  i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don t feel that i missed a thing

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429487,well  let me start off by saying how utterly hilarious this film is  i simply couldn t keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it  don t get me wrong  it is well acted particularly by bassinger but the script is just  well the mind boggles truly  br    br   the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill   half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy s head  she decides to pull out a screwdriver  car jack and finally a flare  as in for a sinking ship  respectively to kill her victims  br    br   then there is the final line that i promise  if it doesn t have you in stitches then i will eat my own left foot  br    br   i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned  appalling film making  might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood  gets me every time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267817,well what i can say about this movie is that it s great to see so many asian faces  what i didn t like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role  the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead  the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the  keeping it real  black cab driver  plus all the coke  shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious  the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel  then again when watching romantic comedies you can t expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once  the parents are the best part of the flick 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211181,a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside  this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery  and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night  the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her  she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and  imagine the suspense here  experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks  from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs  whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family  the earnestness exuded by the mrs  whitfield character has to be seen to be believed  well  the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well  they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school  none of these people can act   as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since   and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on  pause to remember lines  and have all the conviction of a paper bag  the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary  it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends  but by that time i didn t care  the murders are not convincing either  and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend s farm with the people and things on hand there  that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don t learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are  cheap doesn t even begin to describe the budget here with  it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods  someone lent the director a couple old cars too  no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make up  there are so many guffaws ridiculous moments to list  but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved  1 watch the gardener s body well after he has been  slain   len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life  2 the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed  she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method  3 how about the guy playing roaslie s father giving us a cranky poor man s andy griffith  the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot  the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70 s cheese if you will  this isn t a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346293,can a pix ever  ever  ever do anything right  this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format  since a pix doesn t even believe in pan and scan  we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side  of course  not that you are missing much  this movie is incredibly bad  it s very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80  of the movie for no reason

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120764,metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set  released in 1990  metamorphosis seems to be a remake of  the atom age vampire   which also featured a scientist striving for similar results  set in modern times  metamorphsis is not my kind of horror movie  br    br   a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging  pressured by the administration to publish his papers  and  produce some results  or risk losing funding   the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig  at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects  he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner   br    br   the acting is stilted  and  the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film  the score is pandering  and  the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious  it s absurd  it s ridiculous   at best   br    br   as others noted  the end turns into a 30  minute gag  which is seemingly endless  without giving too much away  i d call this one   dr  jekyll and mr  hyde meet the creature from the black lagoon meets home alone  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178130,watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life  if nothing catastrophic happens before i die  this will be the biggest regret of my life  who ever even thought about this movie  or financed deserves a kick between the legs  because that s where they were thinking when they made this movie  it s about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic  and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry  he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast  where they meet girls and such  only the fat guy doesn t get a girl  skin flicks don t annoy me  i take  em for face value  but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick  it s about fat guy looking for love in some girl  but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry  he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies  only he has his lady anyways  the dialogue is super horrible for even a c movie  it supports a ton of black stereotypes  no character development  it s a glorified porno movie  without any porn in it  never ever watch this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072130,why is it that any film about cleopatra  the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making  whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all  julius ceasar  and his successor  mark anthony  never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors  despite lavish sets and costumes  this movie is as bad as any italian  sandals and toga  extravaganza of the 50 s  admittedly  this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen  which is why  gladiator  went over well  but  gladiator  did not have all the romance novel sex  br    br   miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor  but timothy dalton has talent to spare  pity some of it didn t wash off on the others 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116684,30 seconds into the opening credits  i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie  but i didn t know just how bad  then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie  we ll have to turn the volume down  make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd  but that didn t help  about half way through we turned it off  now  i ve lived through some very bad movies before  both with and without the aide of  mystery science theater 3000  and  svengoolie   but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save  the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they re zombies had rotting green skin  i guess they were all hypnotized into death  then hypnotized into rotting themselves  stick to the real b movie cult classics like  plan nine from outer space  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089308,left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars  the acting is weak and uninspiring  the story even weaker  the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith  not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking  the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action  the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat  the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful  even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget  however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it s wholesomeness and it s religious leanings  and who can blame them  however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790781,ironically  although he can do the  splits   thomas is a complete stiff as an actor   br    br   this film is seared into my memory as one of the most side splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen  as such  i m actually rather fond of it   br    br   still the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape  and it s fun to see his tiny  muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side  including the infamous  pommel horse  shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers   but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote  and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits   br    br   thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn t really an actor  everyone else in the film   actors  director  editor  camera guys  etc  is at least as bad  or even worse  and most of them are professionals  so kurt doesn t come off quite as badly as you might think   br    br   i hope poor kurt took the money and ran  if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again  i ll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493247,i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all  the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason  they are usually true  but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters  the  fresh of the boat  dad  who doesn t understand his daughter  the radical feminist muslim daughter  who by the way is a terrible actress   and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  he s a pretty good actor  i only see him getting better   br    br   it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well  there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed  and don t really care to watch another episode  br    br   i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again  she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does  too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217749,the movie is bad  nothing special   just a  kid  movie with no serious thing in it  there is though one reason to watch this for  the animal talk  some of them are so funny in what they say  you just can t stop laughing  so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying  i m keyser soze   or another animal saying  you re a dead cat walking   or many other funny one liners  see it  cause there s no other good movie to watch it  vote  4 out of 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995752,yes  i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael bennett s hit musical  it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985  it is awful  almost everything fails  first off  attenborough  a fine actor  a good director with the right material  is a sorry choice   almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie  the camera is always in the wrong place   they chop up the songs and the casting    they are awful   the power of the play was these dancers   these hungry  talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance   you couldn t take your eyes off of them  but this cast just gets by dancing  does a  nice  job singing but none of them spark one bit  in fact  look up the cast on imdb   none of them really went on to do anything much   ok  ok  janet jones married gretzky   sheesh   so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic  the desperation  the passion of the stage musical  a total strike out   but even though they try to smother the music   the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042619,as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre  especially those which are the products of my native cinema  and i can say that that the  power of fear   or  vedma  as the russian title of it  is one of the weakest film among them  firstly  it can t scary even a little kid  it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror  frankly speaking  it s bad in all points  from the goofy plot  i don t know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller  i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer   it doesn t thrill a bit  and to the terrible and cheesy actors  work  all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn t even bother to play at all  only spoke their english lines without any expression  and at the end i don t really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors  i think it was their wrong turn  at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing  the same i can say about so called  small american town backgrounds  which were shot in estonia and look like it  the only positive moment i found in the  power of fear  is the visual effects  they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film  and the music is ok  at least it doesn t irritate me  that s why i give it two stars  overall  if you want to see good horror film   don t waste your time and money on this boring flick  and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i d advise you to find a copy of  viy or the spirit of evil   it s really the terrific movie based on the same novel as  power of fear  but much  much better 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445760,i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was  i usually enjoy bad movies  but this one was so revolting that it wasn t even entertaining  some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie  the hideous special effects  when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate   and the disgusting acting  the acting  in fact  is what i feel steals the show  i didn t recognize any of the actors in the movie  and i hope that i never have to see any of them again  overall  i recommend renting this movie  if you can find it  i can t imagine a video store carrying this garbage  just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368078,i first heard about white noise when i saw the tv advert  before then i didn t even know it existed  i watched the trailer online and decided that i would go and see it  now being a fan of films like the sixth sense  i thought that this film would give me everything i wanted  it has michael keaton in it  and he rocks  unfortunately the film did not deliver  it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echoes  and failed miserably  it has a very promising start  but the middle just drags on repeating itself  and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out  unfortunately like most  scary  films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump  this film could have been so much more  it s a shame because it was a good idea 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459392,madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past  his next film page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time  it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india  after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie  i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd  coincidently i did  the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation  i literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children  very disturbing stuff  there was no need to show the children fully naked  one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people  british men in this movie  i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india  otherwise super flop in uk  usa and australia  i m from uk  and this kind of stuff makes me sick  shouldn t of been released in uk 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128239,i rented this movie on dvd  i knew that the movie wouldn t live up to what it promised me on the back of the case  but once i saw that leatherface  gunnar hansen  was in it  i had to rent it  it starts off pretty good  with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable  however  the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever  and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging  there are way too many unanswered questions  there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise  but overall this is a very sub par movie  but i guess it was worth the   3 99 rental fee 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207093,it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken identity marital romp  coming off the success of her first romantic comedy  ernst lubitsch s masterful  ninotchka   1939   where she was ideally cast as an austere russian envoy  garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom level story that has her playing karin borg  a plain jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her  once he makes clear that work is his priority  karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high living twin sister katherine to test her husband s fidelity when he is back in manhattan  br    br   it s surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george cukor  who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937 s  camille   because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend  only someone with carole lombard s natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by the numbers script by s n  behrman  salka viertel and george oppenheimer  mgm s intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and americanize garbo s image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties  br    br   however  garbo appears ill at ease mostly as the bogus party girl katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like douglas and constance bennett as romantic rival griselda  photographed unflatteringly by joseph ruttenberg  garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the  chica choca  dance sequence  the story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of sonny bono s death  roland young and ruth gordon  in a rare appearance at this point of her career  show up in comic supporting roles as douglas  associates  this movie is not yet on dvd  and i wouldn t consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in garbo s otherwise legendary career  she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming  i can see why 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101917,no wonder this movie never saw the light of day  the timing was of the release was awful  the gong show had already  jumped the shark  by the time the movie came out  so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show  and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic  90 minute whine by chuck barris about how hard his life was as host of the show  did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed up millionaire life  did he really think we even wanted to know about his life   obviously so  since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia operative   did he think the gag of having everyone  everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes  or the network executive hounding him at every turn  this might have worked as the plot for a 30 minute sitcom episode  but not as a full length movie  however  it was nice to see rip taylor  gene gene  and the unknown comic again  although  to make the movie  spicy   they included only his most vulgar routines   and as someone else has pointed out  this is phil hartman s first significant movie part  even though it lasts only a minute   note his name is spelled hartmann in the credits  which is the name he was born with  you can t miss his voice and facial expressions  even though he s much thinner and younger than in the snl days  ed molinaro  hill street blues  also has a tiny part  one of his first after leaving the soap world

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107653,while i watched this movie  i tried to figure out why they bothered making it  though the main plot of the movie is potentially good  there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots  the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys  perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex  it s odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress  the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed   i really didn t feel like i knew any character  except that everyone is corrupt and evil  the ending is totally incomplete   it left me more than just wanting what might have been  but what was supposed to be  in the end  there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do  except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross  i m surprised that so many established  and good  actors agreed to make such a hollow movie  this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project  br    br   don t waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110823,what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is  just one year after  the breakfast club   a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in  st  elmo s fire   who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles  br    br   was it the directing or the writing  since it was the same person  joel schumacher  it must be both  but then schumacher has since given us  the phantom of the opera    phone booth    a time to kill   and two batman movies   batman and robin  and  batman forever  which range from good to great directing  something went wrong on  stef  because it has no genius whatsoever  no comedy worth anything  and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life   br    br   example  the character wendy  a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham   reveals to billy  an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends  drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe  that she is still a virgin  billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy  is not ready   wendy  in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends  later in the story  when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together  billy is leaving for new york  deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter  he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect  going away gift  from her to him  and wendy  who works as a social worker helping broken families  seems not to be phased at all by this despot  give me a break  the one thing she can only give once  she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends  schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment  br    br   many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue  br    br   i suppose some may say that  that was the 80 s  but i remember it was in the  80 s  that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out  br    br   i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right  br    br   as for the technique  not the story   it was terrible as well  it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes  transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense  pick up what is on the editing room floor  put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better   but it still is a horrible movie  br    br   maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986  he must have  or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo s fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way   that is what i really think happened 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384118,i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance  i decided pretty early on that this just wasn t my kind of movie  br    br   for the most part  it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography  the scenes of early 70 s manhattan look very good  as does the lead actress  it is a very crisp black and white  which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh  however  some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell  the disjointed editing is very late 60 s  somewhere between surrealism and new wave  the story also feels like it came from a very specific time  somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation  br    br   the film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with  as she meets other odd characters  she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs  the movie seems to be meant as an off the wall  irreverent comedy  but adds an avant garde feel  i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies  you would be very excited to discover the telephone book  br    br   some problems i had  near the end of the movie  one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes  brutal to sit through  also  there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the film s climax  i did laugh out loud four or five times  and i liked the ending  minus the flat out disgusting animation   and when the film switched to color for the final phone booth at night sequence  i actually liked the way it looked even better  it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different  but this is what the filmmakers gave us  it is obscure  artsy  and way left of the dial  but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own  i didn t find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426236,a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott  g i  jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals  the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character o neil played by demi moore  there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldn t reach it properly  it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film  br    br   i really can t understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert   it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique  when i look at his latest film  black hawk dawn  there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes  which are plenty  and they are very intense and directed with skill  the whole finale in g i  jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing  br    br   this is ridley scott s worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known  still i m glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scott s abilities  but they are very few in this film  br    br   a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics  blade runner  thelma   louise  alien and so on    of this talented director  so i m forced to give g i  jane 4 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119303,this was awful  andie macdowell is a terrible actress  so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job  but then remember that turn in four weddings  equally as excruciating  another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages  and village greens  i mean that school  how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that  the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat   a nauseating british series set in the 60s  this film just couldn t make its mind up what it wanted to be  a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women s friendships  if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked  i say just   but those scenes just didn t work with the tragedy in the second half  i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour  a final note  what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo  not to mention anna chancellor  macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480035,so  american pie  beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series  although  it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it  can t that guy get better gigs    br    br   there is very little to compliment this movie on  there aren t any funny jokes  the acting is painful to watch  especially the girl with the  southern  accent which sounds more like a canadian s impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word  ya ll   this movie makes me feel like such an idiot  why didn t i apply to a college where nobody goes to class  but everybody gets good grades   girls consistently take their clothes off in public  everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis  and you can ejaculate all over a girl s family photos without her minding  really  this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn  maybe for the next one  they ll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead  i m sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stifler s 3rd uncle once removed or something like that 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028174,it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there  this is by far not one of the worst out there  still not a good movie  but not the worst nonetheless  go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst  the film has decent camera work and editing  which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films  br    br   the film doesn t deliver on the on screen deaths  there s one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck  but all other deaths are hardly interesting  but the lack of on screen graphic violence doesn t mean this isn t a slasher film  just a bad one  br    br   the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously  the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle  so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements  done in a tongue in cheek way  for example  after a kill  charlie goes to the town s  welcome  sign and marks the population down one less  this is something that can only get a laugh  br    br   if you re into slasher films  definitely give this film a watch  it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers  but not by much  the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious  you may forget the movie  you may remember it  i ll remember it because i love the name 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120206,an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans  it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face  namely that we ll all be dead in a few hundred years  which is already indisputable  but who cares  humans are selfish  destructive creatures  i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction  i ll just call it a  natural progression   let the apocalypse begin  but meanwhile  we have to listen to the same brazen  slanted politicians who propose another  new society   well  don t be fooled  we ll all still be controlled by the wealthy  by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place  nothing will ever change  br    br   al gore  whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film  as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer  he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion  the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle  tobacco  pig farming  which accounts for methane gas traces  and who knows what else  his wealth is predicated on exploitation  greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records  i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate  but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party  that is all  meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling  this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he s lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques  he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets  uses product placed computers in the documentary  and yet he thinks everything is a  moral issue   he s entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares  he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister  from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things   did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines  no  everything must serve the  economy   so why is he any different  the answer is he is not  br    br   his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous  all this while he s being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes  well mr gore  why don t you try living like the common people then  he is a politician  plain and simple  he has a career invested in the power structure  my question is  why doesn t he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications  he doesn t do that because it would be unwise for  investments  stocks and corporations   br    br   al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary  namely to wealthy white people in the audience  who clap on cue  while showing them graph charts  numbers and percentages  and speaking in a dreary tone  no one without a harvard  which the elites control  education can make sense out of it  but he tells us everything is going to hell  no kidding  but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet  namely that it is expendable and a waste dump  he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems  he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system  its obvious he was spoiled  sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing  inconsistent dullard in washington  whoever made this propaganda  as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived  had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse  that is to say  someone is going to benefit  and it seems the  new green  politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the  new utopian future  with  new technologies   it s the same old story  al gore is a believer in the elitist structure  he actually believes there is a  democracy  in the us which i find very naive  if we aren t paying wages to the oil companies  then we ll be paying them to the wind and solar companies  br    br   i find the speech at the end quite rancid  along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses  gore speaks about  people uniting together to defeat communism  in the 1990 s  what it had to do with global warming  absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people  with that said  he didn t understand that communism never existed in the world  the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism  no less different than what controls the us interests  social ecology was not even mentioned here  which is really a travesty  if you want to change the world  then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed  exploitation and violence

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493424,unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes  br    br   for a short film the cinematography  costumes  sets  sound  editing and everything else is very  very good  this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals  so the quality is to be expected  the problem  as usual  resides in the story itself  br    br   thing is  it s not really a story  to tell a story  or in cinema s case  show a story  you need plot and conflict  you need things that happen to the protagonist  events  these events happen because the protagonist wants something and  for some reason  he can t get it  tim watcher has no problems or goals  he s a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind  that s it  so what we have here is pure exposition  instead of being shown a story  we re simply learning things about this tim watcher individual  of course  considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film s short duration  it s hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice over narration  in this case it s used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we d never glean  in fact  if it wasn t for the vo we d think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things  to make it worse the vo also explains what s happening on the screen  the images we re shown are just decoration for the text we re listening to  br    br   i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something  but because the images don t stand on their own it s impossible to say that  what s left obviously has value as a measure of the crew s technical capabilities  not incredible  but good  but fails to entertain  amuse  thrill or  at the very least  show a story

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028174,i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted  so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom 1   2 and saif ali khan s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback   br    br   after watching it  i understood that why their wasn t a proper trailer because there wasn t anything in the film to show  the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line  there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it s difficult to figure out that who is killing who  also the action was daft   unrealistic e g  1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns  br    br   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films  br    br   sin city  during the opening credits  br    br   koyla  anil kapoor s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla  br    br   jhoom barabar jhoom  the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny  br    br   i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom 2 and i don t know where all the money went to  anyway if you did not like dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan  race was hot on heels and that is a million times better  br    br   the only 2 good songs are dil haara   challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor s terrible english couldn t save this discomfiture

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127388,skullduggery is a strange  strange film based on the novel  ye shall know them  by vercors  to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind  since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity  and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance  but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone  skullduggery simply isn t a very good film  for me  the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message  the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk  later it teeters into sci fi fable  by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics  the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great  too jarring  to overlook  they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled  disorganised movie  br    br   an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple  burt reynolds   one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame  susan clark   after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures  these primitive  long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man  there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man   the  missing link  in the evolution of apes into humans  or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual  or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics  the archaeologists call the tribe  the tropi  and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery  but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen  paul hubschmid  declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers  he questions whether the tropi are truly  human  and takes his argument to the courts  where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued  br    br   this was a very early film in reynolds  career  and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously  not that reynolds can be blamed   he has an impossible role  asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick  his character and the film are not relevant to each other  clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist  and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox  alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white  a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance  rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids  the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical  and that s just not the right idea  we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures  but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing  skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant  philosophical and stimulating  the honourable intentions are there for all to see  but the end result doesn t do them justice  a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321018,although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films  after watching this  movie  on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down  even if it just helps cleanse me once again  br    br   the film was possibly the shallowest experience i ve ever had   the main characters played by danny dyer  23  you sure   and gillian anderson  who will always be scully as leonard nimoy will always be spock  had no real substance about them   i m not sure if the first half hour of the film didn t make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims    here i couldn t care less  in fact  the only character i did seem to care about was the dog  with the stag coming a close second  and both animals out acted dire  sic  and scully  who were quite frankly terrible  i guess though you re only as good as the script you are given  and i d like to warmly thank the writers  the producers  the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082764,in short  this movie is completely worthless  br    br   the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future  an interesting idea  but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief  so the idea just flops  br    br   apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed  but as a graphics person  the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening  the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality  and i don t understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking  if anything  the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics    they don t measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics  the models for the robots were so simple  plain and very uncompelling  there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island  but they are not explained in any way  br    br   the story is horrible beyond belief  in fact i can t believe i didn t just walk out of this movie  the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated  and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception  why is the morris paley character even there  we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic    i mean he flies a plane  and saved one person  polly  for personal reasons  yeah there s a great hero for you  dex has very little screen time  so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him  who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault  and why would they do it  remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic   br    br   plot holes   1  why did bai ling s character  a major fall from her excellent character in  the crow   halt the robots who had captured joe  they were looking for the vials  and had not found them   2  why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed  he doesn t have or know about the vials  and the bad guys didn t know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex    3  polly indicates that  they  don t know anything about totenkopf  yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him   4  the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese    if they know all about this mysterious area  then why the hell is their map blank in that spot   5  at one point  polly and joe have to give up their clothes  they are burned     joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes  yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress  then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back  br    br    sigh   how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap  br    br   we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music  even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen  br    br   and the acting  we re supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents  which character isn t annoying  i think ling bai s dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie  she doesn t have a single line   the dialogue wasn t camp  and doesn t even rise to the level of cheese  its just bad and annoying  these people aren t hero s or compelling  they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life  br    br   i can t believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb  imho it should be competing with  batman forever  in the bottom 100 of all time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081432,eric rohmer s  the lady and the duke  is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution  but it s a stilted affair  with its strange  painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone  most notably  this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action  one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie  and little of the chaos  poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted  but spoilt  aristocratic classes  the result is frequently dull  and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction  it s a disappointing film from an acclaimed director

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191915,this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment  this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90 s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies  the most famous disasters in their ouvre are  subspecies    seedpeople  and  trancers   none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid  actually  hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film  doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless  i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs  i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you re a fan of him  for every good movie  it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones  anyways  the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers  one good one who s here since 150 years to protect the humans   jeffrey as dr mordrid   and one wicked one called kabal  he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot  combs gets his instructions from mentor  that  guy  only exists of a pair of eyes in space  very very cheesy  that is   every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that s about the only form of special effects this movie has got  the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other  it s over before you know it   i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little  but nooooooo     in some scenes  you really can detect some originality and creativity   like for example jeffrey s lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals   and if you really pay attention  you might even find some very small but nice aspects   like the raven which is called edgar allen  but overall  it s a terrible waste of time and energy  i m a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes   but he sure doesn t have to put on a stupid maillot for that 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430304,actress patty duke wrote an insightful  funny  rough hewn book about her career as an actress  her crazy quilt love life  and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good  with this rich material to draw from  and patty playing herself in the final act   one would think a crack tv director like gilbert cates could bring it all together on film  but  call me anna  is a pale shadow of duke s autobiography  for those who haven t read the book  the sketchy narrative  leaping forward in time  isn t absorbing  we are never allowed to get our bearings with what s happening  and the production seems stunted by a low budget  the actors are miscast  and the value of having duke herself finally appear does not pay off  the film s phony reality is so thick at this point that patty can t bring stability to the scenario  it appears as if the producers were sincere enough  and consciousness minded  to anxiously steer the film towards duke s ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom  but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116449,if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non communication and false ideals  then this is the film for you  if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest  then you should probably look elsewhere  there are many films that do this far better  for example  try some of the darker films by bergman  the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end  if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours  like cleaning your house  for example 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120041, intensive care  by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner the acting is abysmal the action is slow and the climax is laughable a famous surgeon has a car accident he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage  intensive care  is clearly influenced by american slasher films including  halloween  and  friday the 13th  series the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look you ll laugh until it hurts with this one you can believe me

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547,strange  almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie  is it because it s from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling   br    br   maybe it s because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book   i have not read the book  but i don t think that s a problem  film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book    br    br   or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022273,two qualifiers right up front  i actually think joe don baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director  the  cape fear  remake  a small role in  goldeneye    walking tall    and i even liked baker in  mitchell   because he was playing an anti hero who was supposed to be unlikeable  yes  mst3k s coverage was hilarious  but they took a lot of cheap shots at baker   that he didn t deserve   to keep things lively and entertaining   he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie  and he was the best part of the movie  br    br    final justice  seems to be more of the same  but in spite of the exotic locations and the  cowboy frontier justice  theme  it is quite a bit weaker than  mitchell   and the main reason is that baker s character  as written  is an idiot  the movie has the conceit that because baker embodies old style frontier machismo  he challenges his opponents to old style mano a mano quick draw contests  and because he s so tough and macho  he always wins  even when he s hurt  wounded  outnumbered  etc  br    br   that s a conceit with a lot of potential  it worked for gary cooper   even if it condemns the film to  b  movie status  but baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy s henchman to a showdown in a public market  with civilians all over the place  he could have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy s headquarters  which was why he was following them in the first place  and they never would have noticed  or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender  and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point  but no  he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead  and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout   br    br   this is a guy we are supposed to admire   br    br   the whole movie is basically like this  most of the supporting actors are somewhere between ok  the henchmen  to pretty good  the chief bad guy and his father  who are two well known european actors   they just go through the motions  but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent   but through it all  baker s character pulls silly   unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed  plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force  br    br   on the positive side  since 90  of the movie is set on malta or in the mediterranean  you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras  and really  baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic  but he isn t that bad   certainly not the tub o  lard that this films critics  including mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage  seem to think  br    br   in short  this movie is good for video wallpaper  but the viewer should not pay any attention to it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255798,i ve been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons  br    br   1  this is  without doubt  the worst film i ve ever seen 2  unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list   which it deserves to be 3  i was kinda lucky   i paid five pound for it  i ve seen it in shops for 15 pound  don not pay that much for this film  you will be very angry 4  there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating  in my opinion  and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal br    br   the plot summary  a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world   well  the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else  our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang   sitting on swings  baby sitting  he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police  br    br   why is it so bad  to begin with the acting is very very bad  someone else compared it to a school production  no  this is worse than any acting i ve seen on a school stage  br    br   i ve bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this  okay  the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense  what was the point in making this film when there isn t even any gore  okay  no gore  what else can a film like this offer  breats  no  not even any titillation  br    br   it s true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is  at best  worth only one out of ten 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995752,very  very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise it didn t take me long to guess who it was  in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas  stevens leads her girl gang of three  and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated  despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70 s  very average yet credible acting from most involved  and a plot line with potential  las vegas lady lays one big boring egg  it seems forever for the film to kick into gear and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up  i was somewhat disappointed with this film  sure  i wasn t expecting anything great  but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70 s or something like it  not even close  no one dies  there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo  one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter  the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall  there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument  beyond that nothing in terms of action  and as for the girls  don t expect much there either  stella and her girls both very mediocre yet pretty talents  get in a sauna and a bath  what do we see  nothing but a fleeting side profile  stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents  but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance  that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film  alas  it was not to be  and i have little to say in this film s favor  it isn t a horrible film in any way  it just has nothing going for it either  yawn

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358,after seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago  i was curious to see the unedited version  i was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than i remembered  but one thing really stood out  i think other reviewers have mentioned this also  namely  what exactly is the nature and motivation of the chris sarandon character  has he raped other victims before  is he completely psychotic or an  average  sociopath  how did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister  is this character at all credible  or is it just a matter of more background being necessary  he seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character  and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young  vulnerable girls  this seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general  it has nothing to do with his performance  which is terrifyingly convincing the movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject  without quite settling into either mode  not the worst movie ever made  but not all that good  either

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114658,i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it  i m left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film  this is potentially a very good story  but it fails to hit the mark  the script is very weak   the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes  the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question  how did we get here   at least a half dozen times during the movie  br    br   there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members  this is probably related to lindsay lohan s antics during the filming  it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job  but didn t commit to their roles  br    br   this is not a movie worth seeing   go for a walk  play a board game  take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that s worth it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232908,when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following  the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside  it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra  conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated   on a per capita basis europe  britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america  it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society  by doing so greenstreet  deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie  this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clich  idealist left wing ideology  this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition  greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies  the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy  movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash  sensationalism at its worst anti  usa garbage shameful 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0918927,the title above is used to introduce the film  gen  to its audience  gen is about a young doctor doga rutkay  with an ill mother  the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job  while she drives  we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area  as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital  she sees the death body of a patient  this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days  br    br   two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide  in fact  they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions  all their communication with outside world is cut off too  there is no way out   in those few days  there will be more nasty murders  now everybody suspects from each other  br    br   in my opinion  the idea is brilliant  it could have been very scary indeed  there are positive sides of the movie of course  i really like the beginning of the movie  especially  when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital  actings are okay  some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though  i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie  what i am saying is  it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end  we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening  the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn t work well  also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital  lastly  i would like to say a few things about the director  i am sure he will improve  this is his first attempt  i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old  that made me feel more positive about him and his future films  i am not going to rate this film   out of       though 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083170,it s hard to criticize this movie  because i dislike the story itself  and no amount of good acting would have saved it  think  raising arizona  with a mean streak  the acting is passable  but jennifer tilly is way over the top  yet not enough to make this a nice camp film  as usual  coming in somewhere between  misery  and a sarcastic dmv employee  the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation  either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise  a real degrading few hours of film  darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood  i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out  sorry 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427688,lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves  he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii  then he quipped   the less said about that the better   indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances  the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter  it was a film to be taken seriously  like other good original films  filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point   this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front  there is absolutely nothing scary about it  it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes  lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning okay  i ll cede ferdy mayne too   lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things check out that ending with him and stirba   lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania  the story isn t really worth examining here  and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise  sybil danning is here and  yes  she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again   one reviewer said 17 times i counted ten   but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point   i gave the film three stars  but it really deserves a zero   the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms  danning s contributions  yuck 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840999,by 1941 columbia was a full fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm  paramount or warners  that s the best thing that could be said about  adam had four sons   a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman  top billed for the first time in an american film  and warner baxter  bergman plays a frenchwoman  this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another  hired as governess to baxter s four sons and staying on  with one interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907  until the boys are grown men serving in world war i  just about everyone in the movie is so goody good it s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through   she s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh  it s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles   but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous  no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted  the valley of decision  four years later 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089280,in sum  overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes  the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres   in this case drama and comedy  well  at least here  these two mix like vinegar and oil  to boot  the comedy is not very funny and juvenile  additionally  the film is not really realistic  liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals  i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on  eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover s son  by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover  marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover  at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them   either ismael or primarily nora  to the detriment of the audience  viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael  her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital  there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed  the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball s chance in hell  the actors do their best and are appealing  but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing  editing and lack of focus 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472033,i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand  the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing  the movie didn t have the  battle of wits  feel to me  the actors just spewed out mouthful s of nonsense  at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on  the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end  i m not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach   even the ending was predictable  and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume  everything from the fake accent  terrible dental work  costume shop facial hair  everything pointed to it being a disguise  the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life  this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show  really boooring in my opinion

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424,i admit that the majority of this film was uninspired but i was still entertained  it has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy above average music and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves there s no prissies here  i can think of dozens of other films that were way worse at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary they allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics destroy everything in sight even if it means the people you re supposed to be saving also  how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist  fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work zombie beyond gates of hell in an effort to somehow improve on them he failed but definitely not miserably like a number of people would have you think i have a soft spot for zombie films  so i admit that i m somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them all i m saying is that this movie is good for one time around if there wasn t so much descension in the making of this film fulci quit and bruno i can hack with the best of them mattei took over it could have been much better and more focused it s going to stay in my collection as fulci s zombie swan song one surprising note  is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off i couldn t believe it myself check it out you ll be surprised 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089913,no movie with madeleine carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable  that said  i have to add that this british film comes close  the story takes place on board the  ss atlantic  and it s loosely based on the  titanic s  unfinished voyage  the word  unsinkable  is spoken  the liner strikes an iceberg  and we hear a heavenly choir sing  nearer my god to thee   the doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem  in a clever bit of sound work  but the year of the film s release  1929  means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage  these aren t problems  the film s major flaw is pacing  and pacing had been well developed in silents  however  if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed  the movie s running time would be cut in half  the intended effect was drama  and clarity in a new medium   but the result unhappily is tiresome now  the film s structure is preposterously illogical and inept  paradoxically  i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique  fine  abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another  sometimes even on sound effects  although we re on board the  atlantic  from the first shot  we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact  there are long  intrusive musical passages by the ship s dance orchestra   entertaining  easy sound   personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way  don t even think of spectacle  the berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship s hull is a minor dent  however  the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats   clearly staged on a real liner  presumably tied up to a dock   generate great excitement  other than the glorious miss carroll  these sequences are the film s only points of excellence  as the movie and the ship near their end  the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail  their last  eternal blackout is the end of the film  with a sunset sunrise tacked on  a clumsy symbolic effect   atlantic  is a cinema curiosity  at best  br    br

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085863,this complete mess of a movie was directed by bill rebane  the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti classic monster a go go  as i was nearing the end of the cold i came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60 s shocker  the story   such as it is   is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games  whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win  1 000 000  it s a very simple plot but rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible  things happen  characters are completely forgotten about  nothing makes too much sense  and then it ends  weirdly  i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly  i guess you are left to draw your own conclusions  production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard  in truth pamela rohleder  shelly  isn t even that good  she is so unbelievably terrible she s compelling  sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap fest as a whole  it s just a bargain basement rotter 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796207,jack black is an annoying character this is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds do i have to write eight more lines ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black this movie is a pg 13 version of an indie film i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture this movie explores mexican culture deeply  i just choke on its cultural rudeness jack black is just so rude  a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture  as it were mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy  such as myself could seek i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here  br    br   i think imdb changed my review has anyone else had his review changed as well just a question 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120361,first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman  in this film  you will not see a single sailing boat  you will not see sailors  ghosts  or anything remotely exciting  it is not the story of the ghost ship  and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn t have watched it  because i really thought it was the film about the legend  it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship  since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the  flying dutchman  legend    i don t understand why  it is maybe based on the resembling legend called  the wandering jew   or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend  the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes  unfortunately  it is the only battle scene of the film  then you see daniel emilfork  who was krank in city of lost children  for about two seconds  and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting  unfortunately he is very bad in the film  the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi  who was one of italia s best actors ever  and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the  wise man  of the film  and boy  does that film need wiseness  every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement  yelling  torturing others  in excrement   fornicating  in excrement  or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it  it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another  coming from a dutch director  you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece  elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven s film   flesh   blood   such a great film  the thought of  flesh   blood  would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good  unfortunately  and unlike  flesh   blood   there is no dramatic progression  no fights  no good acting  and put simply  no  flesh and blood   the photography  as the opening sequence unfolds  is well done and enticing  this too  stops very early in the film  the music  from nicola piovani  of  la vit  e bella  fame  is repetitive and annoying  when not irrelevant  it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence  while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung   throughout the first  act  of the film  which lasts nothing less than an hour      the film takes place within the same perimeter  which is around the farm where the main characters live  the characters play with excrement a lot  drown in it  play in it  a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character  a young boy who loves to play in excrement  to become older and play in excrement some more  the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian  spanish conquistadors speak french  nothing makes sense  everything is confused and takes hours to happen  then there is a second act called  the ship   in which we see what might have been a ship  a long time ago  but which is now remains of a ship  covered with excrement did i mention    the main character  while walking a bit further away from the farm  just happens to run into it  and decides it s really cool so let s live in it  the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him  but he doesn t really mind because  did i mention   he s not very bright  he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it  until more conquistadors show up  at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i ve said it s really confused who s who   make the dutchman a prisoner  along with the retarded hunchback  and they burn the ship to the ground  the last part of the film  which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle age peasants fighting in it  takes place in a mad asylum  yet more torture and drowning each other with feces  yet more loitering for the director  who seems to have definitely given up on his job  or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job  in the end  a lot of the mentally challenged new  friends  that the dutchman made die  the woman he had sex with who was his brother s wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son  the dutchman and his son talk  the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances  then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends  while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don t have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065380,despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch  the murder mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving  although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed  it s obviously a pre code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there s even a song singing the praises of marijuana  the performances are all one note although it s nice to see carl brisson in a musical but when victor mclaglen  as the police lieutenent  lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues  you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast forward to the next number  pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247164,previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm  but it was a severe disappointment  lupe valdez is great  but doesn t get enough screen time  frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters  but the script leaves them stranded  br    br   the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy s character  who is at best a self centered  physically and verbally abusive jerk  the reactions of  the public  are poorly thought out and unbelievable  making the  shenanigans  seem like contrivances of a bad writer  and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him  br    br   the  stinging one liners  mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer  since i didn t even notice that an attempt was being made 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481280,and when i watch sarah silverman  i get the same results  i love quirky  irreverent humor  but this woman is so darned b o r i n g  annoying  and yawn worthy  she s also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous  the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she s just not funny  i watched two segments of her program and was ready for novocaine  br    br   geez  my kid  age 19  saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a  dumb chick   i thought that was a compliment  the one where she says  watch my show or i ll kill my dog   is actually believable  i know she s a wanna be comedienne  she just comes across as a warped nut case  i just don t ever want to see her around my dog 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472205,i don t know what this movie is about  really  it s like a student s art school project  they never say why the world is dark  but it is always darkness except for seconds a day  there are long  interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason  what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images  a black woman enters the main character s apartment  somehow she becomes pregnant overnight  then gets shot in the head  the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges  i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be  honestly  i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it s about  but i wouldn t wish this level of hell on anybody else 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080391,if you like to see animals being skinned alive  their heads smashed  dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them  then this one is for you  but if you are somewhat normal  and don t need to see real footage of animal cruelty  pass this one up  this movie tries to shock the viewer  and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning  and the killing of babies in the movie  fake at least its was enough to make myself turn it off i ve seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage  btk movie  and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know its just make up  and special effects  so we shouldn t sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals  its not what we rented the movie for if anything  there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won t be surprised by it  as a very hardcore horror fan  this one turned my stomach  the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196267,i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story  this is basically a story of possible redemption  racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust  br    br   a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife  if morris mishkin  zero mostel  will only believe in the angel  belafonte   his wife fanny  ida kaminska  will recover  the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel  br    br   when he believes it  fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly  it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris  br    br   jan kadar  who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966 s  the shop on main street  directs this film as well  kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn t convey the desperate situation that she faces  she keeps calling for ruthie  their daughter  who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion  for most of the film  she does not realize the angel s appearance in her apartment  br    br   the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel s girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment  is memorable but all too brief  br    br   we don t know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died  br    br   those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408309,this is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead  but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark guy  kind of like in beauty and the beast  it could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks  but there are some pretty gross plants instead  they make this one girl really itchy  so she lets herself get eaten by the shark guy instead of scratching through the whole movie  the scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to  he even arranges for them to have private time for s e x  but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark guy is an ugly  icky monster and wants nothing to do with him  she gave up on love  just because he was a shark  i thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he d turn back to normal and they d live happily ever after  but it s not that kind of movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425638,i  loved  the original scary movie  i m a huge fan of parody  it is my favorite form of humor  it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor  the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film  then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel  i think the wayans  are a family of comical geniuses  alas  even geniuses make mistakes  br    br   the movie begins with promise  i liked  the exorcist  parody  especially the  come on out  ma  gag  now  that s wayans quality material  but  other than that  i can only think of two other times i laughed  1  when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit  then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him  meanwhile  he s saying   it was just a booty call    that was kinda funny  2  the  save the last dance  parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves  but even the short lived giggles are no match for the side splitting laughs of the first scary movie  br    br   the rest of the movie is pure trash  filled with cheap gross out gags  jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone  for example  in scary movie i  several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay  this was hilarious  but  in scary movie ii  the whole penis strangulation scene with ray under the bed was mind numbing and incredibly unfunny  this is the pattern of the whole film  shock humor  alone  doesn t take a movie very far  this was a trend in 2000 and 2001  unfortunately   br    br   as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low  i have to give this one a 2 out of 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077696,okay  first off  seagal s voice is dubbed over for like 50  of the film    why  because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions  from the very beginning  you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting  but they make no sense  br    br   that said  the story still sucked and doesn t make any sense at all  when i got the the end  i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn t even make sense  br    br   avoid like the plague  this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459392,i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully  me thinks he  the lady  doth protest too much  the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself  he sites profane literature  writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible  a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible  anyone can skew data   prove anything they like but it doesn t make it true  customs change  word definitions change over time  look at english   german where it is very obviously a common root  nothing stays the same  it s always growing and changing  the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research  in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics  these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped   the mean of the entire verse changes  writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces  without punctuation  without paragraphs   without numeric verses  these writings look like one long word   the translators added all of the above  for example how would you read this  godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here  same string of letters two entirely different meanings  this is why many biblical researchers use a  lexicon  to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic  greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written  it s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn t exist  in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty  talk about ego  putting soapbox away  god bless maegi
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303816,having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered  having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling   i simply couldn t believe it  the movie is really awful  in fact it is so awful  that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced     during this  i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so called comedies from the 60 s and 70 s  the pattern is as follows  take one extremely popular comedian  make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible  add a bunch of jokes  especially one liners   and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls   film that  and you have a success  i wouldn t know if this movie was a success  but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly  with a few great comedians  it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486640,the plot is about a female nurse  named anna  is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living  she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer  so far  so good  i usually enjoy horror movies  but this piece of film doesn t deserve to be called horror  it s not even thrilling  just ridiculous even  the flintstones  or  kukla  fran and ollie  will give you more excitement  it s like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor  the heroes who has locked themselves in  inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside  are not better either  even though they doesn t seem to be drunk  they give the impression of being mentally disabled  save your money instead of spending it on this

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102175,the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used  if ms  pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer  br    br   otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies  as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value  which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get  perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to  de commercialize  their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing   movies by definition are a commercial thing    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400944,in the first one it was mainly giant rats  but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too  this one  however  is just giant rats period  well giant rats and one really growing little boy  this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats   you know how it is  this movie has some kills and its moments  but i find it to be on par with the original  i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies  well  that is not true   i actually like  empire of the ants   maybe i just do not care for giant rodents  all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre  i just can t recommend this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113754,i ve written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published  so i must opine that someone at imdb com really likes this awful movie  the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade  and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous  so is the acting and direction  pass on it

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050599,zombie nation 2004 r br    br   hey  i was bored  i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch  zombie nation  hey  i love zombie movies  says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description  funny how it doesn t warn me not to watch this film  i could ve used that advice  br    br   zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it s completely misnamed  it has little  if anything  depending on your point of view  to do with zombies  and takes place all within one city  this film revolves around a crooked cop  who acts as badly as possible  he has to be trying to suck this much   while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them  yup  he s a serial killer cop  not only is this film flawed in thinking that it s a zombie flick  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong  serial killers enjoy killing  they live for it and they get down and personal with it  this guy knocks out the women  and injects them with some poison  he doesn t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it  talk about boring  eventually  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy  they were all buried or tossed into the ocean  but you wouldn t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they re all wearing  the women then act very poorly and take their revenge  oh yay  br    br   this film was crap in every category  crap acting  crap writing  crappier sets  and crappier make up effects  the women don t look zombie like  unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie  they can all talk  behave  think  and act perfectly human  the gore is weak compared to even many pg 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief  you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence    then the exact same breasts later  go figure  guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite  the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they re obviously filming in  you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even  unless you are blind  you can see the director failing  steer clear  it s a waste of time  br    br   1 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120430,as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie  i was immediately excited  the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn t wait to see the second one  especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies  however  when i saw it  i left the theater extremely disappointed  as did many other movie goers at the theater with me  while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always  there simply were too few of them  in the first movie  there was constant fighting going on it seemed  but the second took a much more  and much unfortunate  preachy point of view  to sum up the plot  there wasn t much to it that wasn t expected  the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it  that s not a spoiler  everyone saw it in the commercials   the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous  unless you re a psychology major  you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie  and because of that simply won t care  it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity  agent smith  for as bad ass as he was in the first movie  seemed to get all religious and preachy  personally  i don t need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it  the movie was a serious waste of my time  and i don t think i can watch the first one anymore  the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly  and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge  and the ending of the movie shoved me right off  what movie ends with  to be concluded   how original is that folks  i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one  in conclusion  the movie was bad and that s the end of it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245407,well  how do you even rate a movie such as this one  does it even have cinematic value really  it s a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible  basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl  not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really  br    br   it s obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible  however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended  the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking  as well as sounding  they are often just kicking into the floor  rather than into the girl  obviously  also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame  i mean if this was real  surely she would had screamed it out  there is more moaning than screaming in this one though  br    br   the movie is obviously low budget and it s a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking  with very limited resources  don t really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released  though it must had done something well  since a total of six sequels got released after this one  br    br   fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie  though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie  br    br   4 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410162,i ve found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers  for american people in general  pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years  each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts  which have none to do with a terrorist attack   or criticize american s political behaviour  or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11  shame on them 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390468,i like silent films  but this was a little too moronic  as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i can t  i don t think any version of the movie even comes close to the book  and don t try it out on kids  they might freak  and the lady who played pollyanna  how old was she  38  i know the labor laws were different back then    but come on people

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963,john huston s wise blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of flannery o connor s book than i could have imagined  from the utterly terrible acting performances  and don t you   oh that was done on purpose  you just don t get it  me   to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of rockford files  this film was revolting  i viewed it with no ill will at the outset  and  in fact  expected a pleasant experience  but the misrepresentation of the southern characters  from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting  comedic way their faith was portrayed  was inexcusable  right down to it s end  which was completely devoid of any character sentiment  it failed in every place that o connor s book shined and resonated  the actors portraying the  southern  policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot dogs from nyc street stands and quoting godfather  the one redeeming acting performance was ned beatty s lively and dead on representation of hoover shoates  a religious con artist who hears moates preaching the church of christ without christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities  o connor s powerful book is most well known for it s creepy  religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of  faith   mr  huston s film is a shameful mockery of the author s intentions  as they are understood by me and most of her fans  if i may be so bold as to say so  while i acknowledge that i can t know exactly what the author wished to convey  i have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan  if i viewed wise blood the way mr  huston apparently did  i would have thrown it in the trash  for flannery s sake  and mine  i forgive you  john huston  the forgetting    that will take some time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075921,i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back  i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve  the martial arts would look realistic eventually  the special fx would actually look special  i was so wrong  i love horror  i am a complete gore hound  i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world  this however was not made in the eighties  if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad  it wasn t so it hasn t got that defence  the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture  i don t like hostel  never have  i thought it was over rated  over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists  however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage  the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming  i m still waiting for the twist that was promised

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848538,what else can you say about this movie except that it s plain awful tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this but that s it but their talents are wasted in this junk i think that they used a double in some of adam s scenes like when he s running because you can t see his face if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare just think what he must ve felt about appearing in this    if it was before or after i m not sure but still zombie nightmare is a classic check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last compared to this the gang is very annoying and over acting by some of the actors a rip off of the wild one starring marlon brando of course tina looks stunning though i hope her and adam got a good paycheck   pass

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480242,kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness  the plot is so contrived and unbelievable      starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain  then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people including clergy  involved in what is a crime everywhere  next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces  a very unpleasant and coo coo mother  aided  abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends  moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina  did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget  the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service  kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade  also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads  i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all  the movie i kept surfing back and forth to  had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much  unless you like an unbelievable story  wooden acting  a contorted mixture of religious mythological allegory my advice is to skip this one  oh and maybe a small carping criticism  but wouldn t a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat  the best part of this movie is the scenery

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231775,i found darkness to be just too dark  it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas  not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go ugh  but  it was underlit to the point of confusion  you don t really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film  you already have all that nasty grain to deal with  as with nathan schiff movies  it s just too much  director leif jonker seems to want to make an original film  but he lacks the know how to do it  the camera is never pointed in the right place  lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well  the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy  but despite these negatives  the music is good  the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances  is this a classic like it says  is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise  no  but it is a good first try  now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie  from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished  for a while and try again  they may do better

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326820,i can t quite say that  jerry springer ringmaster  is the worst film i have ever seen  the film would be better off if it were  because at least the worst film i ve ever seen   prom night ii  interested me enough for me to hate it  my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed  it had seemed much more like years  it is an endless repetition of poor people   or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are   screwing each other  hitting each other  insulting each other  and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing  the plot  which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill  advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters  this makes it impossible to care what happens to them  it never mattered to me whether they got on the show  or what they said  or who slept with whom  maybe i m not supposed to care about them  maybe i m supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type   to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny  too bad it isn t  the humor is not outrageous  it s innocuous  it s predictable  humor has to have something behind it  some kind of painful irony or life experience  in order to function  scatology is not wit  an example  a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed  to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter s boyfriend  since i was over the shock of jerry springer s show a long time ago  i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay s obscene nursery rhymes  not laughter  just yawning  lastly  i found springer s pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing  if he really were an advocate of the poor  he would bring on a single mom from bed sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on  12 000 a year  or  failing that  he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits  jerry springer gets millions for his shows  his movie  his book and videos  his guests just get round trip air fare  hotel accommodations  and a chance to humiliate themselves  if he liked poor people so much  he d give them at least some of the money they earn for him  it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself  jeez  with all his fine work  you d think he d have earned our respect already  anyway  the film is weak and boring  it doesn t even succeed at being offensive  if you want to have a better evening  videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108350,no  this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach  fairy godmother and the glass slippers  but if i were to elaborate  i would have to spoil it for you  which i won t  but don t let curiosity get the better of you  as this movie is not fantastic  it s one of those movies that start off promisingly  before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline  and that s real horror  br    br   yoon hee  to ji won  and hyun soo  shin se kyeong  are your ideal mother and daughter  one s a successful plastic surgeon  while the other your dutiful  obedient  and beautiful teenage daughter  their relationship is like hand in glove  so close you d think of them more as siblings rather than parent child  but things start to go wrong  don t they always  when hyun soo s friends  whom yoon hee has operated on  start to go berserk  br    br   perhaps it s a warning to audiences  and for those koreans ladies who don t bat an eyelid when going under the knife  if news reports are to be believed  the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery  though somehow  i thought kim ki duk s time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself  br    br   it s a tale of two halves  the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics  which  i admit  did get to me now and then  however  the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo jumbo melodramatics  and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat  some things begin not to make sense  and while attempts are always presented to explain  you probably won t buy it  not that horror movies are logical to begin with  br    br   the leads are all beautiful  and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role  but hey  i m not complaining  though the storyline could have been improved tremendously  i d recommend you to watch this  only if you re a fan of mediocre korean horror  on vcd  watch out for those face off ish moments

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186589,orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan  richard harris    his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks  unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken  robert carradine  comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale  this raises nolan s interest in killer whales   decides he want s to catch one of them instead  however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female   injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess   enrages her mate  nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens  the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least   kills one of nolan s crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada  once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town   it s people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death    br    br   directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip off was terrible  i m sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous   utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes  the script by producer luciano vincenzoni   sergio donati is so stupid i m lost for words  the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn t help   if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale s are just one more time i ll scream  i m sorry but i simply don t believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to   sink it  i don t believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there  i don t believe a killer whale can identify someone s house  know someone is in there   then wreck it on purpose  i don t believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat  i don t believe killer whales can physically recognise people   i don t believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out  maybe i m being a bit harsh  i mean it s only a film after all but it s a film which is trying to be serious   things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan   hand  or should that be fin   deliver it  the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else  they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold  seriously  that s a statement that s no more far fetched than anything else in this film  i found the film very boring  totally dull   had awful character s with no on screen presence at all  it goes without saying this is a jaws  1975  rip off which doesn t even come close to spielberg s classic  br    br   director anderson is no spielberg that s for sure  this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense  scares  tension or atmosphere at all  all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater   totally forgettable  there s no build up to them   virtually no pay off either as orca doesn t get to eat a single person  then there s the scenes which literally had me laughing  the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy   the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a  loving     caring  couple but i couldn t help but think that this is the closest we ll ever get to killer whale porn  hilarious stuff  the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland   boring  instead of footage which matches   enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else  do you get the impression that i don t like this film  good  forget about any gore or decent deaths either  there s a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you ll miss it  br    br   this probably had quite a big budget   it still sucks  there s nothing outstanding about orca  it s well made i suppose but flat  bland   totally forgettable  the cinematography is quite nice though  the acting is bad  rampling is awful   the late harris  irish accent is embarrassing  br    br   orca is a lame jaws rip off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielberg s film so good  this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere  definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws  the revenge  1987  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759097,but there are not too many of them  probably the worst  major release  film i have seen in my life  definitely the worst for this year  there is no point in commenting on the plot  the cast or the acting  the problem is beyond all that  it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind  not the funny kind  of everything that takes place on the screen  i don t know why i gave it a 2 10 instead of 1 10  probably  because of steven martini  he really did try  bottom line   95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells  avoid at any cost

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089280,this movie is a rather odd mix of musical  romance  drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it  it s basically one messy heap of different genres  of which none really works out like it was supposed to  br    br   this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor  he s a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical  and musical productions at the start of his career  in this movie he picks a different approach  although the musical aspects are still present in the movie   but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie  i mean mickey rooney as a tough player  he s an extremely small boyish looking man  he actually was in his 30 s already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old  hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn t look and feel right  he simply isn t convincing in his role  br    br   because the movie mixes so many different genres  the story also really feels as a messy one  somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all  it just isn t an interesting or compelling movie to watch  l szl  kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime  despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957  he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with  his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality  br    br   let s also not forget that this is a  50 s movie but yet it more feels like a  40 s one or perhaps even as one from the  30 s  this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black   white  generally speaking black   white movies from the  50 s often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception  br    br   it s a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence  it wasn t the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies  often simply as himself  i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music  since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie  the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song  br    br   an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney  br    br   4 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077429,i don t know what i missed here  but i can t believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film  i thought it was silly  and a bit over the top  i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker  however the others were just    boring  br    br   now i like b movies  i really do  but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me  i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to  army of darkness  and  shaun of the dead   as well as  on par with the re animator   you must be joking  i didn t find this film funny  it tried  it did make an effort   possibly too much of an effort   but it failed in my opinion  by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th one liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch  br    br   there were definitely homages made to several other films  which is always cool  kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans  but here it may have just been a lack of original thought  admittedly there were some nice special effects  good gore  but that can t carry an entire movie  the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut  and in the early stages of mutation  chet from  weird science   after he was turned into the monster  and one of the alien creature children from  the explorers   it just didn t work  i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed  then there was brenda  the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn  when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped  the design once again was totally unimaginative  a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle   yawn   br    br   now about the zombies  the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a  romero had a patent on them and was the only writer director allowed to make movies about them  he s the only person so far to do it right  with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg  but that was a comedy   oh  and danny boyle  but they were a different style of zombie  maybe mr  romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan  groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid  and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re animated  the people of  wheelsy  just didn t have the proper motivation    they were horrible zombies  br    br   so in the end i give  slither  a 3  for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070000,   but this just isn t working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good  on what grounds  there are some loose hints here and there  but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing  lynch s movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet  are very playful when doing that  there is some visual sense  there are some subplots  characters  ideas etc  but this is dull and yes  pointless  because whatever there is to explore is either to  small   either too far fetched  or simply told before in a superior manner  it s just lynch exploring dv  nothing more so it should be treated like this  1 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865957,ok i caught this film halfway through  but oh dear god it sounds like they re all reading from scripts  br    br   especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group  although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to   the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting  scripting and general plausibility  it quite clearly appears to be a cash in on human traffic  but whilst that is not the best film ever  it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest yet hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade  not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent  full of clich s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense   i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10  my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker   br    br   if i could give this movie a zero  i would  too bad imdb doesn t allow that   br    br   the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it  whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed  take my word  don t waste your  8 on this piece of trash  the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name  in all  highly not recommended  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0809620,i rented end game  having never heard of it  but i m fond of political thrillers so i thought i d give it a shot  after doing some research on the movie  i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release  but instead had gone strait to dvd  after seeing it  i m thinking   no wonder   the movie is shocking in its unoriginality  the plot and the characters are perfunctory  i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball  i have to say  i didn t expect it to end quite the way it did  but that s not a point in its favor  the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad  perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist  even one that made the movie even worse  br    br   stay away  i want the  5 98 and my 107 minutes back 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327940,take young  pretty people  put them in an exotic locale  stick in a few bad guys  have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes  create the flimsiest of plots  then work out a happy ending for everybody  other than the three or four who get murdered  of course  that s the classic  and successful  format of the harlequin romance  it s not very good but then it s not very bad either  like most of the little yellow pocket books  and the location stuff in budapest is especially interesting  even if they didn t use the wonderful old train station  designed by gustave eifel  or show the city s famous thermal baths 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120793,i go to a lot of movies  often i bring my 5 year old son  i am so glad i did not bring him to this one  there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene  however  that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it  the trailers lead you to believe it is a light hearted comedy  nevertheless  virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews  i kept waiting for it to get interesting  funny  or anything but serious  however  i nearly fell asleep as the plot less story dragged on  i understand that dogs can be great company  that being said  the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train  if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned  the worst movie i ve ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson  a waste of their talent  the best way to sum up this movie is  couple gets unruly dog  couple falls in love with dog  dog dies  couple sad  the end

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119007,robert forster  normally a very strong character actor  is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion  scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the  death wish  vein  it isn t difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings  the dialogue is full of howlers  the crime statistics are irrevocably dated  and the supporting characters are ridiculously over written  particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom   low rent production is contemptible in its self righteousness  especially as the violence in our cities has only increased    from     
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074973,this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him  however  somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn t know where to go from there  br    br   one unbelievable event followed the next  russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time   the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible  why does she still follow him after they got off the ship  why doesn t she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody    the side stories were completely ridiculous  was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny  and what was the story with the younger sister about    still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot  the movie managed to be completely predictable  br    br   the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential  as i said  the idea of the film was good  the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good  too  so this could have been a really good film    but it wasn t

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068356,i saw this movie the other day in a film school class  and i hadn t seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good  unfortunately  it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom  high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don t add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all  br    br   or so i thought  then  the next day  my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie s hidden little details  like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule  apparently  the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this  br    br   great  but you know what  it s still a bad movie  it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film  you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention  something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks  high heels gives us strange  off beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies  and almodovar doesn t seem to be using them to make any kind of point  what is the significance  for example  of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film  why is that even in there  just to surprise us  br    br   there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast  and that s it  that s the only entertaining moment  the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is  but no matter what my film professor says  it takes more than self indulgent trickery for a movie to be good 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332348,blazing saddles  it s a fight between two estranged brothers  dennis quaid and arliss howard   both of whom can ignite fires mentally  they square off over childhood differences  with dippy love interest debra winger caught in the middle  director glenn gordon caron  the tv whiz kid behind  moonlighting   smothers the darkly textured comedy in vince gilligan s screenplay with a presentation so slick  the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant  it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature  but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities  these aren t even characters  they re plot functions  barely released to theaters  the film is a disaster  although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good  winger is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly perplexed   1 2 from     
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818,man  this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books  frankly  i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start  i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened  this movie is vastly overrated  br    br   shakespeare  with the king james english  has never appealed to me  anyway  so it may just be me  there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello  br    br   the good points of the film include   thanks to a restored print   some decent cinematography and a young  slim and attractive shelly winters  br    br   overall  this is simply too boring  too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again  besides  we all know that most actors are nut cases  anyway  but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314204,even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow  wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film  it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in 1981  kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles  as holmes s wife and underage girlfriend  respectively  the rest of the cast has such small roles that it s impossible to get any dimensions from them  the film also stars carrie fisher  ted levine  franky g  mc gainey  dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092545,one could wish that an idea as good as the  invisible man  would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects  but this is not the case  the story  the characters and  finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50 s  there are some great moments  mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets  but alas  soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab  which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable  but schematic  br    br   there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years  and some of them have their charms  but it s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol  classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven  who does have his moments  is a very bad one  it is obvious that the money is the key issue here  the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough  and as a result   hollow man  is seriously undermined with clich s  sappy characters  predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever  br    br   however  the one thing that actually impressed me  beside the special effects  was the swearing  when making this kind of film  modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them  therefore  the language  and  sometimes  the violence and sex  is very toned down  when the whole world blows up  the good guys go  oh darn   and  oh my god    hollow man  gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them  i m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear   but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears  i think we can thank verhoeven for that 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499570,i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british  the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles  it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britain s partition of ireland and domination of its history i e  ni was created by britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of ireland  br    br   the characters are portrayed as hapless fools  even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause   maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community  it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war  no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism  br    br   nineties  values about  machismo   masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish  psyche  which leads to violence  the stupid song from the woman in the club   old ireland of green fields   blah  blah     is given a symbolic stature  i e  poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause  tedious  ahistorical  cheap and nasty trash  o sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479948,one would think that a film about a young person s coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring  think again  this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it s about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market  it s almost as if the film maker  considered  making a movie  but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random  and randomly boring  images and go nowhere scenes  throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting  pretend that good lighting ins t important in the film making process  and wrap it up under the auspices of an  arthouse  film  this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement  and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films  br    br   if you re interested in films covering this subject matter  you d be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logo s website or renting get real  better yet  read stone butch blues  whatever you do  skip this long winded piece of dreck 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438040,this is a poor film by any standard  the story in match point had a certain intrigue  and the direction and writing a certain fascination  woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it   br    br   scoop  however has none of this  it is poorly written  the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all  the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie ups  why are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked rooms    br    br   allen s delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres  curse of the jade scorpion purple rose of cairo etc  have given us so much pleasure over the years  even hollywood ending had a great central idea  sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481280,i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting  everything else about this film is extremely amateur  everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed  not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films  as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor  placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful  whomever the  actor  was that played jack s best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera  i didn t expect much from such a small film  but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings  don t waste your time or money on this film  like i did  you will be sorely disappointed

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331175,oh if only i could give this rubbish less than one star  there were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it  one was where a line or two from the song don t worry  be happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin  that is it there was nothing more amusing than that  at least not for me anyway  doctornappy2 is not right in saying  fans of the completely terrible  shrek  might enjoy  but  wallace   gromit  fans will probably turn away in disgust   as i loved shrek 1 2 and 3 and i also love wallace and gromit  you see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching  this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get  the continuity mistakes were too big in number  some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not  i won t point out all of the others  but here are a few more to see  when the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it  at one point the ruby falls down roddy s back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by rita all the while the ship is moving forwards  in the next scene roddy has caught it again  this is impossible  seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of roddy s shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in roddy s hand  there was a third one i wanted to point out but for now i have forgotten it  br    br   too many  for want of a better word   jokes  were repeated in one way or another  there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters  the characters were hollow  shallow and empty  and the whole film left you wanting    wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else  paint drying or grass growing are two superb options 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360813,green street  as it was called in the uk  or hooligans is a bad film  the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england  has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately  br    br   my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters  don t get me wrong  i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work  but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role  the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal  however he spends much of the film placid and cheery  only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film  this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans  at no point during the film was i convinced that a  he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b  the  firm  of thugs would accept such a person into their fold  br    br   the other main character is played by charlie hunnam  charlie looks the part  and is fairly convincing as a thug  unfortunately  being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england  he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock en y in marry poppins  details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk  but being from the uk it was a problem i couldn t ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me  the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast  especially the role of bover  the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played  with a film like this  you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible  unfortunately  the casting failed  imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes  jack  from will and grace playing michael corleone s part  you would not be convinced  the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities  i am no football hooligan  but i am a fantatical football fan  i know how cliquey a group of  regular  football supporters can be  as such it deem it impossible for a non football fan  who is not a fan of the club in question  is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a  firm  who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases  my final  and biggest  problem with this film  is the way it portrays football hooligans  i take objection to the film s idea that despite being very violent individuals  hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other  this is complete rubbish  football hooligans are complete scum  they take football  the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise  frighten and intimidate people  they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation  they are not brave or loyal  they are cowardly and evil  if the  gse  in this film truly loved their club  west ham  why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name  hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society  football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans  although this film tries intends to show the  gritty  side of football violence  it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport  it does not show the poor innocent by standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins lighters glass into the crowd  it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows  it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone  if you want to see a good film about football violence  watch the bbc drama  the firm

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096870,the people who are praising this film are the real disappointments    i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good    out of this  as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and he s over 70 now  but this film is simply terrible  at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past  and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of leonard s songs  it is so bloody precious with its endless close ups of over emoting singers  cohen s interview is all done in lo fi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body  i couldn t care less about the comments of the performers  especially those overblown ego boys edge and bono  none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as leonard s own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all  heed them  this would be an acceptable pbs special  maybe  for a one time showing  but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this  when the film finally shows leonard semi performing  tower of song  it s ruined by bono taking a verse  even the occasional good performances  antony  rufus  first number  martha s the traitor  are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla  forget this one  and go buy leonard s most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469999, br    br   upon concluding my viewing of  trance   or  the eternal   or whatever the producers are calling this film  i wondered to myself   out of all of the bad movies i could have seen  couldn t i have at least seen one that was entertaining   even if a film is not well made in terms of acting  directing  writing  or what have you  it can at least be fun  and therefore worthwhile  but not only is this film bad in artistic value  it s incredibly boring  for a plot of such thinness  it moves awfully slowly  with little dramatic tension  at the very least  in a low brow attempt at entertainment  the deaths of the characters could have been cool and or gory  but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well  br    br   what does this movie have going for it  pretty much nothing  unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken  who is capable of being brilliant  put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self parody mode  why did he decide to do this film anyway    br    br   i give this film 3 10  because  god help us  there actually have been worse movies made before 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142911,i felt that the movie was dry    very disappointing no plot  kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone   a wast of money   one of robins williams worst films  if you don t believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don t do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over    this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that   plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it     this was on a friday night the 9 50 showing  i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake  when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093910,this 2003 made for tv movie was shown on a women s channel  naturally  as a man  why do i even attempt to watch this  i don t know  but i should have my head examined  and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does  he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in  number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife  i couldn t wait for him to drop her  her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie  the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz  about the coldest person you d ever want to meet  her looks didn t warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious  only a fool could miss  definitely a loser  tembi locke was pretty good  but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband  again played as a guy who is a loser  by david deluise  rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero  stephen jenkins as our hero  or should i say victim  was not that good  at first i thought he just a bad actor  but later i believed it  he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout  although  as a man  i became enraged when the two women got away with it  men  beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder  lmn is the channel  beware  note  having watched this a second time by mistake  i am convinced on my initial thoughts  especially on the writer director  simon gornick  i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped  only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesn t have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins  hyser  hiltz and deluise around her  plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse  down with gornick s movie and his vacant stars in it  please lmn don t show this trite again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434964,this movie is one of the most awful i ve ever seen  not only is the dialogue awful  it never ends  you ll think it s ending  but it s not  how long is it  140  160 minutes  i don t even know  i do know that i ll never watch it again  it s like someone took a romantic comedy  took out the comedy  then decided to downplay the romance  leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen  but don t take my word for it  find out for yourself how terrible this film is 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087313,as the faux russian scientist says two thirds of the way into the movie   i came for the science   this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie   anything that involves a half man  half hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist  or  as they say in the biz  my girlfriend s brother had the remote and the rest is history  to say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects  this is 2005  it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background  yeah  this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming  the birds  but in 2005 it just looks low budget  spare me the cheap attempt at sci fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief  br    br   however  having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film  let me tell you again that  as sad as it may sound  this is probably worth your time  if nothing else  it is a tour de force of bad sci fi   worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day  br    br   the crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind  but also the ability of  b  movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines  br    br   this film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions   bad guys always wear sunglasses  br    br   if this weren t 2005  i would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war  i mean  you might as well have khan on the bridge of a klingon bird of prey inserting leaches into chekhov s ear  br    br   one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the charlton heston lookalike   wait for tom  as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground  the thing is  tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never ending banana clip attached to his kalashnikov  or ak 47  in layman s terms  br    br   as the mad scientist says near the end of the film   my goal is to evolve the human species    suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind  the faint freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389957,this was an atrocious waste of my time  no plot  the acting was so far below par  it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do  it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier  which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel  its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years  and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it  this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name  by comparison  it makes segall  norris  and arnold look almost talented  br    br   perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre  at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891,in the title i write that the story is ludicrous  below i ll elaborate and tell you why it  in my humble opinion  ruins this movie  br    br   gere and danes are doing their jobs  and while it s not their best work  it s quite ok  the rest of the cast  though  is doing a really poor job  mind you  this is not entirely the actors fault  the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth  all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth  or the character is such a clich  that it doesn t matter how hard the actors try  br    br   the director has a bit of a se7en complex  but looking merely at the direction  i think he does an ok job  br    br   but the story  this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways  first of all it s a bad movie script  the characters are shallow  except for gere s and danes  characters   the villains are clich s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable  besides this  the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years  it s the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals  regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them  it s also the kind of movie that says  albeit only between the lines  that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial  judge or jury  and of course  according to the movie  everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance  br    br   so  if you re going to film school and need an example of a bad script  or if you re writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost  see it  for everyone else  i recommend another movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097632,this movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas  capped by such statements like  we all create our own reality   br    br   sorry  folks  reality is what true for all of us  not just the credulous  br    br   the idea that  anything s possible  doesn t hold water on closer examination  if anything s possible  contrary things are thus possible and so nothing s possible  this leads to postmodernistic nonsense  which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas  well founded and stupid  are equal  br    br   to quote sci fi writer philip k  dick  who put it so well   reality is that which  when you stop believing in it  doesn t go away  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347416,seriously  i m all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as goodfellas   but this movie  it doesn t make any sense     and i m not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense  why does her family live in england  or  at the very least  why doesn t she have a british accent  she s sure cozy with her dad and he s surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years   on that subject  no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long   and what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party  i m not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her  that could ve been overcome by better movie making  i m just saying that the characters  the setting  and the plot aren t fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story  oh  and the worst part  in my opinion  is the filmmaker s consistent use of the most unflattering angles on deborah messing s nose  i d have sued the filmmakers if i were her  i mean  honestly  i m all for women being who they are  but why  in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing  have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is  oh  because those producers are kind to her  this movie  like my other least favorite movie ever  armageddon  is the fault of the filmmakers  not the actors  i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better writer  director  and producer  br    br   this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i ve ever wasted time on  i m just glad a friend loaned me her dvd  so all i wasted was time  if there were a way to make this review zero stars  i d do it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499570,full marks for the content of this film  as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii  a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world  however  the movie is pathetic  direction is non existent  the acting is wooden and the script is just one clich  after another  i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together  this could have been a great movie  the story for many of us outside of the us was new  unique and also interesting  the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together  it is unfortunate that a true story like this  which could have changed people s attitudes  has been squandered on a low budget  badly directed movie  i only hope that some time in the future  one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101917,i may not be a critic  but here is what i think of this movie  well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids  secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb    nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362107,the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet  when it s retrieved  one of the crew members is ill  one is alive and the other two are missing  what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member  br    br   while on mars  the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug eyed monsters  oddly  while the sets were pretty good  the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film  plus  in an odd attempt at realism  the production used a process called  cinemagic   unfortunately  this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed  it was that bad   despite all the cheese  the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel  for lovers of the genre  it s well worth seeing  for others  you may just find the whole thing rather silly  see for yourself and decide  br    br   while by today s standards this isn t an especially good sci fi film  compared with the films being made at the time  it stacks up pretty well  br    br   ps  when you watch the film  pay careful attention to dr  tremayne  he looks like the spitting image of dr  quest from the  jonny quest  cartoon  plus  he sounds and acts a lot like him  too 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274321,primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it  br    br   a bunch of terrorists high jack a lorry and kill an entire army doing so  they believe it to hold uranium  but no      it contains two dino s with a taste for human flesh    then a crack team  who might as well be called delta force get called in  br    br   ok  this ain t jurassic park  and yes the dino s are never clearly seen because it s obviously a guy in a costume that s not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur   only slightly less terrifying but come on guys this had about 1  of jurassic park s budget and as such does what it can  br    br   does this deserve to be in the bottom 100     hell no    i think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1   are being way way overly harsh  it s much closer to a 4    it s actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom 100  and has a similar production value to a sci fi channel production   again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb  br    br   the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously  neither does the script br    br   all in all it s an enjoyable b movie   not for film snobs br    br      out of      
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081695,i don t know if the problem i had with this movie is that i was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but i believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film  if you don t have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143096,so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless  i know it got awards and things  but i personally did not enjoy it too much  there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested  just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs  some of the people in are rather different which isn t a bad thing  it just didn t leave a good impression on me  i was thoroughly bored by this movie  no offense to my creative writing teacher  the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn t get it  and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing  the green animals thing was neat  i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers  but how did these four jobs connect  it just didn t make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that  but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it  who am i to stand in your way  i am just forewarning you about possible suffering 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107497,superman ii   the richard donner cut should be a fan s dream come true  at long last  footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life  a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored  it seems like a winning situation  and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  esoteric dream  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence  while it s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project  and it is only a very few times  br    br   you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics  but then we start seeing new footage  alternates from superman   the movie for the trial  and that first bit of hesitation fades away  hey  this is pretty neat  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project  and it doesn t convince at all  and from this point on  it never ever lets up  it s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  you ll believe a man can fly  it s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here  the best effects in this are from the original productions  br    br   another issue with this re cut  a lot of it just doesn t make sense  the only reason any of it really works is because we ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii  a movie that does make sense  lester s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly  part of this could be because donner didn t get to complete shooting  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible  what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent  br    br   after viewing this  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester  the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii  that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence  not ironically  both were filmed by donner  but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing  while lester honored the donner material  lester here is thrown under the bus  br    br   so is there anything good in this release  well marlon brando is in it  and that s neat to see  in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman   the movie  but that only highlights the problems of this release  any of the major scenes  really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section  instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used  sloppy edits and bad decisions  br    br   watch the opening scene at the daily planet  why are we looking at jackie cooper s back as he calls for lois and clark  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on  i was initially confused by this  because i expected to see lois  the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this  br    br   battle scenes are a mess too  with no geography between cuts  it s just random action  of course  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates  they should have used more of lester s footage  but probably had too much pride to admit that  br    br   the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well  as noted elsewhere  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  xk 10  while we all know it s the  xk 101   a blind man in stm knows that  the producers of this assembly  who tried so hard to honor the original film  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production  for all the supposed care that was put into this  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable  br    br   the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner s didn t make this a separate release here in the states  as it is  we re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  play all  option  it s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes  but after that initial viewing  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else  i know after my experience of watching this  i had new respect for lester s version  it s by no means perfect  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief  he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so  while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974959,i gave this a 1  there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for  total mayhem  everyone gets killed or nearly so  i am tired of cross hairs and changing views  i cannot give the plot away  convoluted and insane  if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back  i wish reviews were more honest 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104515,   for the lt to have chosen this one  first  the film wasn t horrible  it was just hollywood  worst case i need this to happen or we have no movie scenario  if willis  mission was to save the doctor  but she was adamant that her  people  make it out of the missionary  he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her  he would not have compromised his package for the refugees  that s not how it works  but  as i pointed out  this is hollywood  we must have drama  this is why we make movies  because reality isn t quite so complicated  however  i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry  that said  there are also some well done battle scenes in the film  it s not a waste of time   tears of the sun  is worth the dvd rental fee  check it out on a rainy day and you ll be satisfied 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164699,jean luc godard s marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you re likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker  bits of political theater  mind numbingly boring and interminable  are interspersed with the making of  sympathy for the devil   featuring the rolling stones in the studio  br    br   the process of the song s development  from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar  to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end  is fascinating  and it s worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones  almost half the movie is devoted to this  so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops  you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together  br    br   when i had this on laserdisc  i valiantly attempted to watch it all  but i don t see how anyone could get through it  i finally gave up and just chapter skipped my way to the stones segments

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821375,what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written  these women have no self respect or dignity  the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys  amanda bynes  talent is completely wasted  she was brilliant on  all that  and her own show  why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid  airhead  desperate  men chasing   old maid  wannabes is beyond me  br    br   their plots and dialog remind me of  the simpons   homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen   everyone should ask  where s poochie    all the talk centers on whining about some guy  and then whining to some guy  sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead  then they get back together or break up at the end  the 2 women are either shallow  stupid  or sex addicts  the only word i can think of is  sucks  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425638,this movie is like the thousand  cat and mouse  movies that preceded it   the following may look like a spoiler  but it really just describes a large class of movies  there is the passionate  wise main character  his goofy but well meaning sidekick with his ill placed attempts at humorous comments  the initially hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable  unlikely  love story  the loved ones taken hostage  and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions  everybody has seen tons of these movies already  and  national treasure  is like any one of them  with only a slightly modified wrapping  every turn of the story was easily predicted  and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed   i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie  and if you have ever felt that way too  heed my warning  stay miles away from this movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097029,i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday  i don t know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis  while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie  there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet  br    br   first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent  the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it s still just no good enough  the gadget mobile is now a talking car  not a car that can turn into a van  plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool  penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all  br    br   the plot is non existent  there s something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that s all i got  what the deal was with the short giant italian guy i will never know  it had nothing to do with anything  br    br   and if the title is anything to go by  his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever  and he stays on the force so why it s called  last case  is a mystery also  br    br   i wasn t impressed at all  this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd  but don t let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can  i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it  no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184135,i watched this movie as a preview of a matthew barney art exhibit  it certainly prepared me  i almost skipped the exhibit and  in retrospect  probably should have  br    br   aside from the score being great  bjork  and the photography rich and colorful  the content was mostly tedious and predictable  gee  i really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl divers were up to  the film was mostly a silly mixture of japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mock hunt harvest  the film  peaks  with enough gratuitous shock art to turn your stomach  br    br   what was the point of the movie  while others might argue that it is an anti whaling piece  one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling  personally i think it was barney s attempt at  flashing  the audience with his anal  fecal  self mutilation  and cannibalistic fetishes  br    br   bottom line  unless you really get off on barney s sense of art  don t bother seeing this movie  the message is obscure  the pace slow  and the cultural references pretentious  if you re after shock art  you ll do better at one of the many  undead  movies or hunting down an old copy of hustler and taking in a fecal cartoon 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071198,years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes  for the uninitiated  john cassavettes was an actor  screen writer and director  married to actress gena rowlands   nominated for oscars three times  who wrote and directed a variety of good low budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat  up until seeing the incubus  we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him  had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether  but we did not walk out  at the time  my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made  now frankly  this is not true  i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax  did i just say that out loud   that are far worse than the incubus  almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus  certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus  however  i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall  when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better  or worse  than the incubus  br    br   http   thevillagevideot blogspot com 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174360,wow  what a total let down  the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous  the special effects were a direct rip off of  the ring   the story  was there one  not in my opinion  just a bunch of flashy imaging  the entire film was a boring  stupid  mess  i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns  however  this is the worst horror film i have seen in years  and that buffy chick  well  she s a bad actress  as plastic as barbie and just as talented  no  wait  that would be an insult to the talents of barbie  i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg 13  and had it been rated r  it would have bombed imo  stupid movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368474,this film uses all art house clich s  slow pace  long static shots  minimal amount of dialog  to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here  there is no plot to speak of  the characters are dreary  female lead  or clich   tersteeghe s character   and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives  the film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery  instead of confronting him  she half heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself  after a fight and a reconciliation with her sister   who knew about the adultery without telling her   she asks her husband to stop cheating on her  they seem to be re united as a family  two other story lines   the planned move of the woman s elderly father with his young wife to guernsey and the rivalry with the woman s sister   do not offer any interesting developments  the suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself  for 2005   or any other year for that matter   this is not enough to make an interesting film  br    br   moreover  what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided  as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move  both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past   over much more important things than furniture  men   this could in theory lead to a confrontation  or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other  either way  this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development  the film clearly sets this situation up  with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws  but it cheats us out of any resolution  the scene simply ends and how this   in itself rather dreary and materialistic   issue is solved  is not shown   br    br   although almost completely absent  the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid  for example  when during a visit to guernsey  the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish  yes it is   no it isn t  ring to it  the fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog   giving a highly artificial  overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact  the way the woman finally   finally    addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed   and is at the same time completely unbelievable  the husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any  it is not shown  the woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband  the scene showing the woman  husband and their young son asleep on an airliner  watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end  but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely  br    br   because of its slow pace  uninteresting story  leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog  i found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art house movie and a complete waste of time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208995,i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid  and there were parts of it  many in fact  that i did not understand  i think i have seen it once as an adult  and i then understood those parts  the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all  so what kind of movie is this  is it a  kids movie   not hardly  it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids  is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children  maybe  but then why wouldn t it focus more on john ritter s character instead of junior  when a film has a 7 year old as its main character  in order to do well with it s audience  it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd  otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate  even 8 year olds wouldn t want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them   i m pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office  and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099327,i did not enjoy the film  joshua  at all  perhaps it is because i saw another  much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it s really just because this film was not very good  i am going with the ladder  sure  the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn t mean the film could not succeed  it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building  boring  uneventful and really didn t leave me thinking anything more than  that wasn t very good  when it was all over  br    br   at the end  joshua s motivations are revealed  i won t give that away but the reality is that he didn t really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother  abby  disappearing about 3 4th through the movie  all arrows point to her returning home soon  she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua s father her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically  so   shouldn t she be coming home soon  won t joshua have failed  won t his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon  i question the father since his future is left open ended  br    br   at the end of the day  i didn t care about the characters  the evil demon child joshua wasn t really scary  the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring  suspense fell flat every single time  when it was over i couldn t believe i had sat through the whole thing   br    br   4 10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil  child  go see orphan  now that s a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079672,have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie  like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house  or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert  yeah  imagine stretching that image to a whole movie  you pretty much got the idea of broken  though there s no detectives in this movie  i m just using it as a visual example  but  the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99  of the screen time  i got nothing to complain about that woman  she s a perfect choice for this role  br    br   i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff  it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall  let s be honest here  the acting is superb  some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching  br    br   now onto the problem of this movie  beyond the mood  there s not much anything else here  the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth  i don t consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is  mirror   let s face it  this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that s all the director got to work with  granted  there are a few twist and turn here and there  if you paid any attention  nothing is going to surprise you in the end  obvious plot holes aside  br    br   now  i m not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time  i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express  movie is not a piece of music  or a picture  or a painting  or even a poem  and certainly not just a cool image in your mind  it s all that plus a good story and character development  i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating  it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium  we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason  therefore  we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting  br    br   this movie is not completely lynch style  thank goodness  it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion  it does not have much story or character development  it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks  thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface  it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it  the oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental  maybe the coherency remains in director s head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen  br    br   where did he put his effort in then  it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music  the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease  only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized  br    br   in the end  i felt like  ok  i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension  it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have  and we are given very little about who the characters are  all we have is this circumstance that just took placed  disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046432,i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie  so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best  about 1 3 of the way through the film i simply had to give up  quite simply the movie is a mish mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it s all disconnected  i love movies that make you think  but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected  br    br   don t think it s david lynch esquire as some would have you believe  it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals  saying it s artsy to disguise the fact there s no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1 5 hours in the film  the acting was good  but that cannot save lack of story  i do agree with the one comment posted previously     it s like being in some other person s head    while they re on drugs   in other words nothing makes sense

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373280,wow  watching this film today  you can t help but be appalled by the writing of this film  spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who  in modern times  might be featured on  the jerry springer show   as they have a sick and abusive relationship   and inexplicably  the writers appear to be endorsing it   br    br   the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy  he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay  it s never clear whether or not they marry  and considering it s a pre code film  you can assume they aren t even though they are cohabiting  their relationship is very strange   and rather sick  while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions  he is verbally abusive and a total jerk   and young comes running back for more like some sort of dog  he calls her  skinny  or  ugly  and these are  in a sick way  his way of using endearments  later  when he starts fooling around with another woman  glenda farrell   she tells her friend that if that s what he wants  it s okay with her    it sure smacks of a sado masochistic relationship and you can t help but feel a bit horrified  sure  he doesn t hit her but the relationship is very abusive  to show how sick it is  when young gets pregnant  she tells him     it s your baby and it s mine  but you don t need to worry  i ll take all the blame for it    yikes  doesn t this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home   later  in a case of art imitating life  tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears  after all  he can t be burdened with a baby  even if it s his  but  he changes his mind and decides to return home  wow   that s bit of him  and  when he returns  he s nasty and acts like if he stays  he isn t obligated to care for the kid   and  she tells him he s  a free man   free as a bird   wow  i was almost in tears at this tender moment   not  soon  this crazy pair are married   and  naturally  young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him  not because of any love or sense of responsibility  so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters  what would you do  well  as for the writers  they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat  the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least  during the robbery  tracy behaves like a chump  doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught  like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison  and  to show what sort of nice guy he is  the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends  br    br   while there s more to the film  the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film  despite both being very good actors  there s absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced  nice music  nice sets  good acting   and a script that is 100  poo  how the film is currently rated 7 4 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters  a horrible misfire that somehow didn t destroy the careers of those involved  br    br   oh  and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong  the answer is no  by the end  she s learned nothing and hasn t changed one whit for the better  br    br   they sure don t make films like they used to   and in this case   thank god

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406816,eight academy nominations  it s beyond belief  i can only think it was a very bad year   even by hollywood standards  with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway  but the oscar nominations really sold it to me  and i feel distinctly cheated as a result  br    br   so it s a black comedy is it  can anyone tell me where the humour is in prizzi s honor  it s certainly tasteless  the shooting in the head of a policeman s wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life  but with the exception of a joke about  your favourite mexican cigars   which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last 50 years  i failed to spot anything of a comic nature   and i did try  there is a lot of mafia clich  but clich  doesn t constitute humour in my book  br    br   is it a romantic comedy of sorts  never  the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben afleck and jennifer lopez in gigli  br    br   is it a cleverly devised parody about the mafia  not in a million years  the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd  and it usually just has the feel of a really bad  and cheap  mafia movie  it feels more like a homage than a parody  br    br   with one dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them  the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces  well it isn t enough  even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression  jack nicholson  repleat with puffed up top lip     now is that meant to be a parody of brando s padded jowls in the godfather     oh  who cares     all i know is  it isn t funny   br    br   throw in some slow  plodding direction  this film drags on for 2 hours   some hopelessly daft and clich d dialogue such as   you remember the camora  well we re far bigger  we ll track you down wherever you go   and clich d mannerisms and you ll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say  capiche    prizzi s honor is far from being huston s  masterpiece  and is rather a very poor last work  it s definitely one work in the great director s canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the hudson river 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189456,this is really really bad  lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job  but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric  i got the evidence on you     makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics   attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn t find it on itunes   talk about seeing into the future   too funny for words  the rest of the movie is forgettable  the score and songs are more interesting than the script  ditto the sequel  which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all  my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies  doesn t say much for the world s viewing habits 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052564,   though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror  there was a distinct lack of blood  br    br   there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing  acting  editing  and script writing  br    br   jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i ve ever seen   his  descent into the maelstr m  of madness is achingly self aware and clumsy  oh look at him twitch  oh look at him drink strong spirits  oh look at him raise his brow  and cock his head at a jaunty angle  oh look at his unwashed  greasy dark hair  oh listen to his affectedly husky voice  he must be a tortured artist writer genius  oh  yes  out comes the poet shirt   it s another boy who thinks he s byron   or poe   oh for the love of    did someone give this guy a manual on  how to act good  or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere  the defunct little plastic toy prize in a discontinued brand of bargain bin cereal  okay  that was a stupid line   but that s only because london s performance has melted my brain with its awfulness  br    br   katherine heigl is cute  and very briar rose  but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film   she delivered her lines like she was being held up  in fact  her whole performance was very wooden  her poses as stiff as her lines   who knows  perhaps she was just reacting to  and trying to neutralise  jeremy london s flailing excesses  but if that s the case  she takes it too far  br    br   notable is arie verveen as poe   while his character s role is confused  he delivers the best performance of the piece  he  quite simply  looks right  but it s more than that   he has some sort of depth  i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two dimensional quality of the rest of the characters  huh  maybe it s just because i like poe  and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen   whatever  he had an interest factor otherwise missing  br    br   the rest of the characters are a faceless blur   there are all the usual caricatures  the perky blonde best friend who s a bit of a floozy  the smitten local cop who s a bit of a dork  the protective older man who perhaps has too much un fatherly interest in our heroine  the scheming old witch  etc   etc   yawn  yawn   br    br   as with the  distinct lack of blood for a horror movie  issue  none of the themes that they mention  and that london s character mentions   so scathingly   in his attack on poe s writing  are followed through on  as another reviewer said   there was potential here  murder  incest    genuinely shocking stuff  but instead they skirt away from the issues  and cut away from the violence  a raised candlestick swinging through the air   closing in on it s victim   then   cut to black  this is fine in a noirish traditional horror  indeed  it s expected  and is fondly received when it happens   it s a dear convention  especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup   but in  descendant  it just comes across as clumsy  or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out   this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller   the horror of palingenesis delusion madness   or a simple  and fun  slasher movie  it tries to be both  or neither  something new and exciting    but either way it fails dismally  the only horror element of this entire movie is it s epic dullness  br    br   i think the editor  if there was one at all  must have been drunk when s he chopped this thing up   there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes  scenes that appeared to be out of order  but that could have just been the poor script   likewise the director   cinematographer   there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning  but just ended up looking silly  again  fine in a noir  but this was trying to be something else   br    br   the whole thing perhaps may have been funny  in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned    omg how did this get made      if i had been in the mood for some trash  bagging  unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch  with the lights down low  with the express intention of scaring myself silly   this is a very poor film  and i m afraid i can t recommend it to people  not even for laughs  br    br   please  please  don t waste your time or money on this   either borrow a real horror thriller film  or find yourself a copy of poe s fantastical tales  either way  you ll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist  sexist and homophobic all at once  while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated  atrocious performances  a cliche ridden screenplay  and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of  two scenes were especially offensive   the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man  could it really have been that gross   and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech s best friend  who is pretending to be russian  after he leaves the room she exclaims  f  king foreigners   so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris    br    br   jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen  and is astonishingly good looking  it s a shame he didn t learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film  and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219400,i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa  considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel  so  i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed  i knew i wouldn t like the movie  but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv  digital video   the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn t for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere  i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots  but there seemed to be no logical explanation   warning  the following maybe a spoiler      the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable  but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous  i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing  but infomercials at 4 o clock in the morning

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167701,this effort was like a glitzy tv movie   i don t recall this ever being released in theaters   if so  it must ve died a quick death  watching the dvd  in the comfort of our bedroom  it was obvious this film was meant for not much more   ed lauter an art critic with a greed streak  what a fun turn that must ve been   i haven t seen ed since  the longest yard    everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers  led by baldwin  except for pompeo   she had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking thru most of the picture   pompeo s daughter had one dimension   she played every scene like a lovable little puppy   slowest line delivery of any 3 year old i ve seen yet    br    br   the chase scenes gave my wife and i headaches   too much quick cutting and angle bashing   if you  re going to shoot a chase scene in barcelona  you might want a few wide shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop  right  the whole story was pretty implausible and far fetched  but hey  we liked it better than  the life aquatic    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088393,i knew my summary would get you  how is this movie like a pet rock and disco   well  unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s  you probably can t understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock  and frankly  at least in the case of pet rocks  i still don t understand it completely   they re just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation  the same can be said for kay kyser and his band  at the time  the 1940s mostly   they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with boris karloff  bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film  yet  if you didn t live at that time  it was well before my time   you wonder why anyone liked this sort of  entertainment   after all  kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very  very broad  i e   unsophisticated and cheesy   frankly  i couldn t stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film  because of these factors  the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed  br    br   the film involves kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live  once there  the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin  eventually  it culminates in some attempts on sally s life and a s ance  of sorts   it s all played for laughs  and it s really not a horror movie despite the cast  br    br   overall  it s passable entertainment at best  as a lugosi and karloff fan  i sure felt cheated having to watch kyser and his knuckleheads 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395978,in a word  this film was boring  it lacked life and spark  a big problem is with the two leads  jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever  he was boring  and she was annoying   br    br   the visuals were interesting  but they didn t enhance the scenes  if anything  the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen  none of the action sequences felt real  and hence  the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger  br    br   the film had potential  but it needed a better script  better acting  and a better director  i kept thinking during the film  you know  this movie would ve worked if harrison ford was sky captain  karen allen was polly  and steven spielberg was the director   br    br   ignore the critical acclaims for this film  the critics i think are praising the film because they  want  to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087951,it s hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool  hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies  while henry fool is refreshing  witty  comical  fay grim is slow  boring  and doesn t go anywhere  where has the wit gone  i am baffled  br    br   it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory  fay grim is painful to watch  this is no fault of the actors  who are good  parker posey  or great  jeff goldblum     the blame lies entirely with the plot  the dialog  and even some of the filming  low budget is no excuse   a huge disappointment   br    br   sorry i couldn t pay attention to the plot  i was so bored  so disappointed    if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much    the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other    there is no continuity in the characters  personalities    it s all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel  br    br   i m switching this off now    henry in some sort of jail with a taliban    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075378,i ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging  the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary  then you get to the movie and it s women with raccoon masks on  zero special effects   and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet  the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie  the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a  cult classic    however  i can t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made  the real horror in this film is how bad it is  i m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331834,there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is  the pagemaster   br    br   i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years  i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out  but this time  i found that the special effects are quite good  the plot is just  the neverending story  with a creativity endectomy  but it s an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye candy  the animation is amazing  and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm  i m giving it a grade of three as i  would  have given it a two  just for parody value  if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story wise 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499603,follow up to 1973 s far better  cleopatra jones  has statuesque black actress tamara dobson returning to her signature role as chic  super tough narcotics agent  here busting a heroin ring in hong kong  cross pollination of blaxploitation action flick and kung fu b movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags  the shoot out finale is right off the assembly line  and dobson herself seems less energetic than before  she s still sexy  and she puts a unique spin on her comically stilted dialogue  but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her  she s jaded   stella stevens plays the villainess this time  she s good  but can t match shelley winters in the predecessor     from     
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082948, the cat s meow  contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue  and some fine performances  a few of which surprised me  eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin  partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer   joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn  and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies  though why movies never use her real life stutter is difficult to explain   but these elements don t add up to a successful whole  the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes  the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted  but not so hard on the big picture  several minor characters don t need to be there  and don t behave consistently  the basic plot is full of illogic  e g   why does thomas ince think it s a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesn t want to hear    and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome  i d like to think a trip on hearst s yacht was more fun than the movie indicates  davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type  which isn t really accurate  and the screenwriter s ideas about chaplin and love are implausible   br    br   strangely  bogdanovich  who seemed so connected to the thirties in  paper moon   lacks a similar affinity for the twenties  he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream  which gives the party guests a very artificial look  and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period  e g    yes  we have no bananas    when hearst insists everybody  charleston  charleston   it looks as if the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot   br    br   the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies  i m sure  but not this time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783608,with these people faking so many shots  using old footage  and gassing animals to get them out  not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors  what s to believe  old film of countries is nice  but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films  i know  racism is ok in these old films  but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility  portrayed as fliers  they never flew their planes  martin johnson was an ex vaudevillian  used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties  denying his wife s apparent depression  using her as a cute prop  all this makes these films unbearable  they were by no means the first to travel to these lands  or the first to write about them  he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer  but that s about it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120042,dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result  violent sexy milligan at his most home made  little better than a home movie  as much of milligans films are  this is a trip into depravity 1960 s style  notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome  playing now more as quaint  though decidedly r rated   the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production  no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke   its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487108,this film is awful  not offensive but extremely predictable  the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60 s  the father  the principal at the school  is going through a mid life crisis  enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students  minds with some thought provoking stuff  like think for yourself  the principal doesn t agree with her teaching but she is pretty  you can connect the dots  his teenage daughter  winona ryder wannabe tara frederick  is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live  she gets some bad advice  hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn t being taught at her school  shocking  seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv  this movie plays like a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252028,i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned  from the domestic violence  to sexuality and many of the taboos therein  outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction  br    br   it s bleak  depressing and hopeless  while i don t mind a less than cheery ending  i m really very tired of the  humans suck  clich  that s central to every movie  i know you can t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race  but how s  bout as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil  right now  if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die  just go out  find a lake and swim  til your arms are tired  this way you won t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive  it s silly  not thoughtful  and boring 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264060,basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child  at the adoption agency they meet a mouse  stuart  and they decide to adopt him  if you think that this is stupid  hold it  because it s getting worse  br    br   stuart arrives to his new home  where he is treated like a human child   spare me   the rest is pretty much the usual clich   about family problems  jealousy from the elder  brother   and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a  happy family   boring and worn out as this is  it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way  br    br   i don t know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich   or he was just trying to fill in minutes  but he only upgraded the clich  from boring to abhorrent  br    br   then why i gave a 3 and not a zero  because of the family cat  who loves stuart as much as the  brother   and because of some funny gigs  where stuart makes good use of his small size  br    br   on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if  a  stuart was a pet and not a  sibling   b  it had kept to the funny gigs  like stuart trying to outwit the cat  and had left out boring clich s which don t even match with anything else 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077450,wow  what a waste of acting talent  my husband and i sat there  both thinking  this has to get better  these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap  unattractive characters  hackneyed script  and listless pacing make for a long two hours  i actually couldn t hack it and left to do the grocery shopping  cat litter being more appealing than this film   the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn t get better  by the time buddy is killed  you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives  it would be infinitely more entertaining  beautiful scenery and costumes can t keep this one alive 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106216,what is it with americans and their hang up with religious gobbledy gook  to think this was a best selling novel is incredible  but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers  in this case  all the good actors have gone to heaven and we re left with kirk cameron as a cnn type journalist    trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared  oh yeah  there s a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine  or something  the good news is that this is done so cheaply  and with such inane dialogue  that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs  not recommended for anyone with a 3 digit iq 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100419,i don t know about you  but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the  often violent  interaction between the two characters  mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york  and as far as i am concerned  this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat  br    br   as magical as jerry s exploration of the  big apple  might be for the other t j fans who have commented here on imdb  i couldn t wait for this self indulgent rubbish to end  so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd  br    br   in fact  the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost  buys the farm   hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle  hundreds of feet above a busy road 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285728,yes  mtv there really is a way to market daria  what started as a clever teenage angst  comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life  sitcom now mutated into a  how you should deal with your problems  charade  i used to watch daria all the time and loved it  now  sitting here after watching the so called  movie  i can only wonder what the point of this all was  daria tells us how to lead out life in college  excuse me  didn t the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok  as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it  this entire thing reminded me of the scene in  reality bites  the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486583,the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya  there is no story  no humor  no nothing  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together  heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed  br    br   i did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  what were these guys thinking       br    br   the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini  br    br   the reason why i did not give a rating of  1  is that every time i think i have seen the worst  bollywood proves me wrong

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470420,was it a thriller  as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library  no  was it a  food fr thought  as the author was maybe trying to make it  not really  so what was it  it was a very average movie  that had great potential  and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points  beginning middle and end  with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy  who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall  it was nice cinematography  with good colours  cool hi tec stuff  beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it s going and where it has just been  and with a feeling of let s just quickly wrap it up in the end  ok to watch if there s nothing else on tv

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079573,strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat  uninspiring drivel  if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter  wouldn t you expect a little passion to show through in her performance  her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes  which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance  were instead awkward and painful to watch  obviously  revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting  and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134744,first off  anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin s  the french connection   is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both  the problem with reviewing this film is that  a   it s a sequel to a brilliant movie  which always makes watching it objectively difficult  and b   it s directed by john frankenhimer  one of the best american directors ever  so i wanted to like it  william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city  because of his documentary like approach to the action and story  frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever  i e   the manchurian candidate  and  seconds   and with his  french connection 2  it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off  that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman s understanding about the original film too  it s well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again  it s also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional  loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character  it shows you hackman  despite being a great actor  had no idea who to make the movie and the story great  the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting  but doesn t warrant the rest of the film  an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer s filmography 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261992,i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time  darklight  br    br   the gist of the film  lilith was adam s first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam s equal and refused to submit to him  see  i took those words straight from the script  then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film  the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do  she ends the film under the control of the faith  an all male group  br    br   other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful  apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film  there was nothing original about darklight

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150,i saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called  it lives by night   that title is much less misleading than  batpeople   in fact it would more accurately be called batperson  this movie is about a doctor who studies bats i am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies  this is not really clear  what is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat  why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me  shouldn t he be able to go in by himself  well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits  they go to the worst doctor ever  the guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse  in the end the guy kills 3 4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109287,this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film   double indemnity   is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script  this grade b tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general  while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black and white films and sought disclaimers on wide screen movies that are shown in pan and scan versions  the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake  br    br   the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script  the billy wilder raymond chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time slot with room for commercials  then update the production with bland  color photography  smart  upscale sets  and tv familiar actors  thus  the brand new  double indemnity  eliminates the atmospheric black and white film noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original  gone are the dusty  shadowy  claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists  desires to escape their situations at whatever cost  gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis  br    br   the look of jack smight s take on  double indemnity  is more  dynasty  than film noir  phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for  and neff s comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman s salary  not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives  neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry  200 000  if not money  then perhaps murder for love or lust  not in this version  richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar  and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister  crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff  and his attempts at double entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat  eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind  only lee j  cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes  director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better work  br    br   there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule  there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double disc package  the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting  lackluster direction  and tv grade production values  the 1973  double indemnity  should be titled  10  indemnity   because viewing it only underscores the 100  perfection of the original movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085863,wow  i thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than i imagined  sometimes i like to watch a good  car crash  movie  those that are so bad that you can t look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get  this is really the only reason i could leave the television on   morbid fascination  it wasn t so much the acting  which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast  but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day  the script  too  is groan inducing  as for cinematography  did anyone else notice that they used a  curtains drawing  segue device  like in an old 50 s tv show   but without irony  at first i thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue in cheek manner  don t even ask me about the score   the only high point is the final song  by morcheeba  i guess they wanted to leave people with something for their  8   glad i saw it on tv      just silly  i wonder if this is why timothy hutton has had trouble finding much work recently  i guess if you don t expect much  and want to watch a mindless thriller  it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails  which is why it merits a 2 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117883,this movie is so awful  it is hard to find the right words to describe it  br    br   at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot  the actors are boring and untalented  perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film  br    br   the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie  i should feel ashame  because i paid for this lousy picture  br    br   hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499603,i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what s up tiger lily with this film  br    br   it has to be one of the worst french films i ve seen in a long time  actually along with brotherwood of the wolves  2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time   br    br   it s really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun  antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings  i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film  br    br   lou doyon is quite bad  as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don t necessarily give you talent  br    br   avoid this film  if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d artagnan 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364913,the author sets out on a  journey of discovery  of his  roots  in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the  completely and deservedly forgotten  movie  bright leaf  is about an ancestor of his  its not  and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self indulgent glorified home movie  suitable for screening at  the director s  drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial   or even non commercial release  a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios   because they are boring  irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his her immediate circles  avoid at all costs 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368268,despite pretty bad reviews  i just had to give this film a go   it does  after all  star hk super babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all action cat burglars  surely that s worth checking out  well  as babe fests go  martial angels is hard to beat  the eye candy is top quality  shu qi looks as fantastic as always  and of the rest of the girls  rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular  br    br   unfortunately  if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits  it is an absolute stinker  the story is weak  the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic  director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else  br    br   if shu qi is the only reason you re contemplating seeing this one  you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062159,what a joke  i am watching it on channel 1 and i think watching paint dry is much more entertaining  what happened to caspar van dien that got him roped into this nightmare  terrible acting  very boring plot and terrible direction  it so terrible  it s funny  it s suppose to be full of suspense  but it more a comedy  if you want to see terrible acting  ridiculous script writing and sub par plot  check this movie out  if i was van dien  i would not only ask for my 10  from my agent  but fire the bastard in the process  what a turkey  it s not even fit to be on mst 3k   it would be a good movie to cure you insomnia  i especially love the part where van dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes  i can only image that this was written by non union writers taking advantage of the writer s strike  what a horrible movie   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384507,ted v  mikels s film corpse grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill  the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens  who are losing a war with dog aliens  looking to get some of this cat food  watching this movie  i began to look for any kind of distraction  anything to reassure myself that i was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out  br    br   several scenes go on for far too long  as characters take forever to do simple things  i ve heard that mr  mikels doesn t like to use jump cuts too often  fearful that they will confuse his audience  i m not sure if this attitude is  avant garde  or just  stupid   try as i might  i could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast  well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory  the majority of the cast are a bunch of no talent amateurs who don t even bother to learn the lyrics to  amazing grace  before they have to sing it on camera  although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality  since i only actually heard around 80  of the dialogue while watching the dvd  br    br   this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot  i ve listened to snippets of the commentary and mr  mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man  what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash  i d like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up  movies i ve long hated suddenly seem a lot better  i long for the intermittedly appropriate music of excalibur  and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead  i need to go do something  anything  don t see this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092359,a study in bad  bad acting  bad music  bad screenplay  bad editing  bad direction and a bad idea  pieces of schlock don t come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this    thing  by the end of the  movie   you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place  poor malcolm mcdowell  was he short of cash or something  still thinking of seeing this   spoilers ahoy   if you haven t died of laughter in the first thirty minutes  by the time you ll see the cyborg populated town named  cytown   you will  avoid this  my movie loving friends  avoid 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112537,pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain  the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties  this is a horrible film in every way  imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video  they would receive a d for this  college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school  since this monstrosity was made by  professionals  i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation  i enjoy watching bad movies like  plan 9 from outer space  but  this thing doesn t even fall into that category  the script  acting  sound  and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable  if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood  blaxploitation  or 1970 s horror films  after viewing this you get the feeling you ve wasted an hour and a half of your life

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302,i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago  and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies  dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin  while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks  danny glover was cast as the bad guy  but   again   most viewers  imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role  also  jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student  the tension was just not there  since the killer was known very early  the finale was  again  neither dramatic nor tense  nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next  all we could wait for was the end of the movie  all in all  a disappointing evening spent at the cinema 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455507,where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk  evil doctors perform their experiments  madmen hold the ultimate karate championship  and the uber rich hunt humans for sport  i had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there  but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location  you d have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there  it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device  hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands  so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began  br    br   the island in this movie used to belong to dr  moreau  but has recently been purchased by the re animator himself  jeffrey combs  old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research  which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer  if that sounds familiar  that s because this is roughly the same basic set up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea  not to mention a host of other nu image movies  so apparently  jeffrey s son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny  he did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth  turning his son into a shark man  br    br   william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor s experiments  if someone would have given him a sailor s hat  william would have been a dead ringer for the skipper from gilligan s island  in typical bond villain fashion  the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son  not chums  like buddies    chum  like shark food  so enter shark boy who starts stalking the skipper and his cohorts all over the island  they  of course  make half hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark man suit   br    br   the movie didn t make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands  it s funny that this movie is called hammerhead  it made me think of an old joke  why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer  because it feels so good when you stop  that s pretty much how this movie is  the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it s over

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407269,this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn t have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie don t see it   but then again thats my opinion
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325597,wow  the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists  i know a lot of those  the guys that ll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror  this  movie  is utter crap  it looks and sounds like a porno  good lord  the soundtrack is awful      and has sub par porn acting  which is shocking  because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor  i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this  most likely  beans  beans  beans    until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day    they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever  when they could have had a very interesting central theme  how do religious zealot anti abortionists feel when it s the devil s baby   but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl  not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed  it s just awful  like  plan 9 from outerspace awful  like  good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful  try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104423,not being familiar with us television stations  when i flicked onto this on my in laws  cable  first i thought it was just a low budget sci fi film  then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist  and then it dawned on me   good grief  these people are serious  it s been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious  i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers  but then i saw other reviews and thought  hey  they can take it  tough philosophical conundrum  how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you re criticizing  answer  make it in such a way that the only people who ll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you re criticizing  i suppose some liberals  ugh  spit when you say that   might be offended at the filmmakers  contempt for those in the audience who aren t obsessed with the j     c      myth  but i didn t mind   it was so darn funny 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314353,there are some bad movies out there  most of them are rather fun   criminally insane 1  was one of those flicks  so bad that it was enjoyable and had re watch value to it   criminally insane 2  has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me  that s saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst  but trust me  this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long  br    br   the movie has a rather incoherent storyline  but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn t being fed  well  you don t see that in this movie  except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one  the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there  but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep  br    br   the camera work in this movie is just atrocious  this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15  the sound quality is something else as you can t understand a word most of the characters are saying  to give an example of how bad it is  go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers  that is what this movie sounds like  not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood  br    br   now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can t describe just how bad this movie is  if you don t believe me  see it for yourself  1 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479651,this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray reagan s administration as incompetent and bungling  some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis  but i m sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie  my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone  but i was wrong this time  there are apparently many others 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110695,the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester  who couldn t act or sing  in the title role  aside from his very bad  acting   all of lester s singing had to be dubbed by a girl  i don t know why they cast him at all  since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well  shani wallis was far too old to play nancy  who was only supposed to be 16  the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way  ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was  it was clearly political to award this old fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848538,first off  i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr  chomsky s mouth  his matter of fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus  he comes across likable  unassuming  pragmatic  he doesn t cater to the current political style  obnoxious bi partisanship  and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right  chastising both  and for good reason  br    br   unfortunately  the film itself is a dud  in fact  i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches  watching  rebel without a pause  is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on cspan  there are no camera movements  no edits  no stylistic touches  there is no story  no narrative  br    br   technically speaking  the production is strictly amateurish  audio is terrible and inconsistent  sometimes we cannot hear noam speak  other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance  when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her  br    br   i cannot recommend this film and would say that you re probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car  br    br   4 out of 10 stars   and i m in a generous mood today 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363290,i was very disappointed with this film  i expected more of a thelma and louise female buddy crime movie  instead  the women prison escapees in this flick  had no sense of loyalty to one another  they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas  who beat each other up  double crossed each other  and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film  br    br   instead of being shrewed thieves  who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money  the women escapees were too selfish and vicious  to trust each other for long  these women weren t liberated in a positive sense  they just ended up being a bunch of loose cannons  incapable of respect for themselves  or each other  if you like 70s female crime caper films  skip this bomb  and see the great texas dynamite chase  which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316886,although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments  i find that the plot and idea are very good  many of the supporting actors were very good  the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo  i am sure  i have never seen a less talented  actor  how this person has ever been in a film or on television  i cannot imagine  in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart  to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles  does beg the question        who does she know   i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent  i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288243,i watched this film version of r d  blackmore s classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 a e version was released on video  and what a poor substitution it proved to be     br    br   this version does not have the authentic  i feel like i m there aspect of the a e movie  the actors are  for the most part  wooden  with sean bean the exception  and the  romance  seems forced and contrived  in fact  there is no kissing until the end of the movie     the triangle between john ridd  lorna doone  or lady lorna dugal  whichever you prefer and the evil carver doone isn t mentioned or expanded upon  we don t get much insight into carver here  or as to why he has some  if any  romantic feelings for lorna  this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel  such as counsellor doone  and john s sharp tongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot  the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction  the political intrigue also doesn t figure in the script  the way lorna came into being with the doones isn t true to the original story  now  don t get me wrong  clive owen is a handsome and talented actor  watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation  but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout  and long hair  it may have been a bad wig  just doesn t suit him     polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress  see enchanted april and patriot games  in which she also costarred with sean bean   but she appears colorless and lackluster  she has a cold sore on her lip that make up can t hide  and the costumes don t seem authentic  the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone  although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter  which she was reputed to be in the book  also  it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles  maybe it s the make up  and the scenery is brown  cold  gray and barren  without so much of a hint of a sunny sky  i understand that it is set in southwest england  but it is green there and they do get their sunshine    the portrayal of tom faggus  character and his  death   which doesn t happen in the novel  depresses the film even more  the one positive note is sean bean s performance as carver  although it doesn t even come close to matching aidan gillen s portrayal in the a e movie  bean does make one mean villain  in short  watch this only if you ve got a few hours to kill  but don t expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel  see any other version   but i highly recommend a e s film  over this tired adaptation 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063210,i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros  i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that  but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia  the movie never really gets through to the person  his thoughts and feelings  what they did was to collect the little material that they had  shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire  it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all  and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say   oh  he was such an inspiration to all of us   like bono or johnny depp  whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean   it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of  the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart  that ever lived  sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him  br    br   sure  being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band  hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such  but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes  br    br   go see the movie if you are a fan  otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros  where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death  melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076270,i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed  masterpiece  of the german new wave   br    br   1  there are major flaws in simple exposition  in the basic communication of critical plot points  as relating to maria s abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband  how many viewers understood that the husband agreed  in exchange for substantial financial remuneration  not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead  br    br   2  the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental  the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald s will  on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald  in the final version  however  maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide  maria is then summarily blown up  rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self delusion and moral compromise  br    br   3  fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private  the political on the personal  contrary to what the critics and  experts  assert  i don t think it works  merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama   br    br   the selfish ambition of maria s rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so called economic miracle of postwar germany  maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place  but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific  women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self advancement for ages   br    br   4  lastly  there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness    fassbinder s drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect  unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen  music is clumsily intrusive in places  and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting  br    br   strangely  for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust  it itself never mentions it once

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814331,speaking solely as a movie  i didn t really liked it  not because there were no fx or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film  actually that was what kept me watching it  br    br   i didn t like it because the acting was shady  his  friends  are all happy and then they re mad  but you have no idea why  then they take distinct roles  one is the believer  other is the antagonist  but they never really make the point  also  the lighting was terrible and i m just mentioning technical issues  br    br   in a few words  i thing the movie could have just had a  ok i m outta here   from some characters  like the lady who doesn t want to hear his version of the bible  br    br   about the story itself  everyone is free to write about what they want  and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination  i credit the book author for that  hence  my 4 10  br    br   so  in the end  hear the man s story believe it or not  just don t spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says  and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don t believe him  br    br   coherence  br    br   thanks for reading   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120481,1st watched 8 26 2001   3 out of 10 dir tobe hooper   scary  yet sadistic which makes sense  portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did  this tobe hooper film really doesn t do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star  freddy himself   robert englund  playing a dual role the marquis de sade and his relative   it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie  could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence  but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes  my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie  it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed  then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hooper s name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore  it s obvious this didn t work

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896585,i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick  i was thoroughly disappointed  it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching  friday the 13th  jason takes manhattan   so much potential wasted  br    br   the opening scene is a decent attention grabber  then it grinds to a halt  copious breasts and egregious 80s fashion cannot help this movie  the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha  i m not asking for  cannibal holocaust  level of gore  but i was looking for cheap over the top exploitative gore  i got none of that  br    br   i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing  hence the 2 stars  i don t think its really worth the time it takes to watch it  though  i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background  but i would not tell anyone   oh  dude  you gotta see this movie   it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323298,now that che 2008  has finished its relatively short australian cinema run  extremely limited release 1 screen in sydney  after 6wks   i can guiltlessly join both hosts of  at the movies  in taking steven soderbergh to task  br    br   it s usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style subject  but soderbergh s most recent stinker  the girlfriend experience 2009   was also missing a story  so narrative  and editing   seem to suddenly be soderbergh s main challenge  strange  after 20 odd years in the business  he was probably never much good at narrative  just hid it well inside  edgy  projects  br    br   none of this excuses him this present  almost diabolical failure  as david stratton warns   two parts of che don t  even  make a whole    br    br   epic biopic in name only  che 2008  barely qualifies as a feature film  it certainly has no legs  inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history  soderbergh s 4 5hrs long dirge just goes nowhere  br    br   even margaret pomeranz  the more forgiving of australia s at the movies duo  noted about soderbergh s repetitious waste of  hd digital storage    you re in the woods   you re in the woods   you re in the woods      i too am surprised soderbergh didn t give us another 2 5hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts  because he still left out massive chunks of che s  revolutionary  life   br    br   for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure  soderbergh unaccountably alienates  if not deliberately insults  his audiences by br    br   1  never providing most of che s story   br    br   2  imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition   br    br   3  ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events   br    br   4  barely developing an idea  or a character   br    br   5  remaining claustrophobically episodic   br    br   6  ignoring proper context for scenes   whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts   br    br   7  linguistically dislocating all audiences  even spanish speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english   and  br    br   8  pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension  why  at this late stage  the t shirt franchise has been a success   br    br   our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevara s memoirs  so  like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment  soderbergh s product is exceedingly limited in perspective  br    br   the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge  scenery and circumstances of the  revolutionaries   but that doesn t elicit our sympathy  instead  it dawns on us that  ah  soderbergh s trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time   but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies  why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them  and keep us equally mentally captive  such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose  br    br   part2 is more chronological than part1  but it s literally mind numbing with its repetitive bush bashing  misery of outlook  and lack of variety or character arcs  deltoro s che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill disciplined troops  the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant  revolutionaries   some of whom violently lack self control around local peasants or food  we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions  nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency  such as it was  br    br   part2 s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic  again  nothing is telegraphed or contextualized  thus even the scenes with fidel castro  demi n bichir  are unexpected and disconcerting  any selected events are portrayed minimally and latino centrically  with part1 s interviews replaced by time shifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president  joaquim de almeida  and us government officials promising cia intervention     br    br   the rest of part2 s  woods  and day for night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they re eyeing the exits  br    br   perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many non american latinos about never getting a truthful  unspun history of che s exploits within their own countries  when foreign governments still won t deliver a free press to their people  for whatever reason  then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the not so well read   i may not be able to read or write  but i m not illiterate    cf the inspector general 1949   out to their own local cinemas  the film s obvious neglects and gross over simplifications hint very strongly that it s aiming only at the comprehensions of the less informed who still speak little english  if they did  they d have read tomes on the subject already  and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves  learning the lessons of history as they should  br    br   such insights are precisely what societies still need  and not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south america  yet it s what che 2008  gleefully fails to deliver  soderbergh buries his lead because he s weak on narrative  i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this  it s been 44yrs  hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted  it s what i went to see this film for  but the director diabolically robs us of that  br    br   david stratton  writing in the australian  03 oct 2009  observed that while part1 was  uneven   part2 actually  goes rapidly downhill  from there   charting che s final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail   which     feels almost unbearably slow and turgid   br    br   che the guerilla aka part2 is certainly no travelogue for bolivia  painting it a picture of misery and atavism  the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour  and the dramatic  yet tragic  capture and execution of the film s subject  br    br   the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing  irritating misery  shockingly  for a soderbergh film  to be avoided at all costs  it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject  2 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075921,as a dane i m proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years  it s a terrible shame  however  that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism  in fact  it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies  and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters  br    br   i know it s wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie  so let me stress that  villa paranoia  would be a terrible film under any circumstances  the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film  furthermore  waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money   br    br   erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings  i particularly enjoyed  de frigjorte   1993   as an actor he is usually funny  though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies  namely that of a working class slob who s down on his luck  partly because he s a slob but mostly because of society  and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community   br    br   this is problem number one in  villa paranoia   clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer  which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible   br    br   it is much worse  however  that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on  for instance  the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work  after that  the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge  this is symptomatic of the whole movie  there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters  and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is  telling instead of showing  thus  at one point  you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels  because the script wouldn t allow him to act out his feelings  and later on  voice over is abruptly introduced  quite possibly as an afterthought  to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director s ineptitude  fortunately  at this point you re roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters  let alone the so called story  br    br   the acting  which has frequently been a problem in clausen s movies  can be summed up in one sad statement  s ren westerberg bentsen  whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother  is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast  br    br   i give this a 2 out of 10 rating 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083189,okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious  some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot  unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year  don t get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely  the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together  so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098061,i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer director  i could not have been more disappointed by this move  the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall  the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent  not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr  hopkins falls into this category  of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years  this is absolutely the worst movie ever  please do us all a favor mr  hopkins and stick to acting  which you are excellent at  and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas  if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071627,leave it to geniuses like ventura pons  the spanish director  to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film  the sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material  most of the pictures that are made in spain fall under two categories  those about the spanish civil war  that love to present past history as the writers deem fit  the other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the  creators  don t have anything interest to say   br    br   as the film opens we get to watch pere s penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party  later on  sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire  the story of pere s attraction to sandra  a married woman that seems to be happily married  is false from the start  br    br   our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier  better made picture by mr  pons   amic amat   but alas  it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture  as far as the comments submitted in imdb  all the negative votes come from spanish viewers  which speaks volumes coming from them 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102116,if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt  305 oklar  as it is promised by the tag line  you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt  305 oklar regarding most famous issues like sex  marriage and cheating  to much nudity  which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt  305 oklar was unsuccessfully to  try something new  as he has quoted  to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt  305 oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is  sex sells   i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique  however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt  305 oklar s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126814,i am a huge ziyi zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple butterfly  as much as i wanted to like this movie  i have to agree with many others who have commented on it  it is very confusing and also extremely slow  because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera  significant portions of it are out of focus   br    br   the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn t tell you much  there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation  the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow  even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about  i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on   br    br   i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous ziyi zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed  she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn t have anything to smile about  i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398417,what was the worst movie of 2003   cat in the hat    gigli   mais non  i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year  badly written  badly edited  and  if i may be so bold  badly acted   the order  is the black hole of film   a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck  it isn t even accidentally funny  like  for example   showgirls   br    br   you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn t going to be very smart  they renamed the movie  originally titled  the sin eaters   because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was  even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie  instead  they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there  br    br   and  hey  what do you know  they were right  my ex girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in  congratulations  producers  you ve met your target market  she also liked  grease ii   so you re in good company  br    br   back on topic  heath plays a catholic monk from a specific  you guessed it  order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor  he has celibacy issues  possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion  much less be a celibate monk  the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy  as much as i ve wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen  his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python  thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny  you know the sort of people i m talking about  br    br   if i utter any more  i would be in danger of generating spoilers  frankly  the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402247,unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there s nothing to spoil about that movie even if b  mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director  but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty  nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min no sex  no blood it s suppose to be about snuff   no actors  no dialogs  just as bad as an 90 t v film it s even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno  you will stay in our minds forever anyway  thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi 3  robowar rats  l altro inferno virus  cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco s spirit s new film  pass on this one but if you don t know this nice artisan s career track down his old films and have fun 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119764,an accurate review of nuremburg must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie  valkyrie   tom cruise    valkyrie   2008  at long last tells the world there was a german resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats  military generals  soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the nazi political regime  install a new chancellor  obtain peace and close the concentration camps  however  these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the french resistance just next door  history writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the german people completely supported the nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing genocide and  unconditional surrender  that was imposed on the germans   br    br   the german enigma codes were broken by english scientists in 1943 so much of what the germans were doing was known  during 1943 the germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including arado  heinkel and messerschmitt  however  even if the nazis were eliminated and the german resistance succeeded the allies wouldn t allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters  jet bombers  high speed submarines  ballistic missiles and radio guided missiles without the usa having them first  this is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant  consequently  the german resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate adolf hitler  the 20 july 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the germans to obtain peace  instead  the germans got ultimatums of  unconditional surrender  and 24 hour saturation bombing in an agenda to avoid peace  the allies wanted to steal the world s greatest technology and scientists from the germans and contain complete ownership through an  unconditional surrender   it was a premeditated allied agenda to allow the war to perpetuate and keep the nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after d day before allied armies advanced into germany to steal the world s greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun  however  tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the german resistance for their own greed   br    br   the allies imposed  unconditional surrender  on the germans as a pretext to complete ownership and control of german property and government and it was done without using the german resistance to over throw the nazis  the allies wanted to steal the world s greatest technology and scientists from the germans to achieve world technological supremacy  consequently  everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of german people in the 24 hour bombing  the concentration camps stayed open  the war was prolonged and led to the  cold war  with weapons based on german industrial achievements  technology  and scientists taken from the germans in world war two  br    br   the 1946 nuremburg war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder perpetrated by the allies as retrospective justice to the nazis  it was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the german resistance overthrow the nazi political regime  br    br   tens of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the german resistance to an agenda but they inflicted retribution against the german chiefs of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at nuremburg war crimes or not although the allies had perpetrated genocide to achieve world technological supremacy

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087258, this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed  that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made for tv movie  br    br   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago  it s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults  plus it s got built in quality sequels  but disney fying was not the way to go  the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book  it is a complicated and emotional story for kids  there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it  there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs  w s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that  there was no reason to remove meg s glasses    that deprived us of what could ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book  br    br   i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off  take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies  the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth  it looks like earth  it has people on it that look like humans  the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing  but something is a little bit off  the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie  the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love  it would ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm  br    br   i unfortunately did not watch the end  maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well  br    br   overall an artistic disappointment  br    br

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190524,     may seem far fetched     but there really was a real life story   of a man who had an affair with a woman  who found out where he and his new wife were staying   and she killed the wife   making it look like a murder rape        br    br   in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him   so she quit her job in wisconsin    and moved to minnesota           br    br   last i heard she was in a mental institution  security prison     br    br   she was still wearing the  engagement ring   that she has purchased for herself    and had told everyone that he had bought it for her  br    br   the events took place in a small town in wisconsin        and the murder happened in minnesota       br    br   there even was a feature story in  people  magazine    spring of 1988  i want to say on page 39  i remember this as i was in college at the time   and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0334541,this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen  and i don t mean that in a good way  we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller  so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store  for once  the film was everything we d expected  and more   or should i say less   br    br   the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera  the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats  and the script  don t even get me started on the script    and just when you thought it couldn t get any worse  it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending  br    br   take it from me  this film is hilarious if you re into crappy horror films  but if you want a good film  keep on looking  this is not for you 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084698,ok  forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold  forget the hideous special effects and poorly constructed one dimensional characters  just looking at the premise of the story  the very reason for the film to exist in the first place  and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together  br    br   i know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it  the story is horrible  the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible  and whats worse  is that the cable movie channels keep showing it  its on twice a day every two or three days  why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times  much less to see it at all  br    br   my recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing  its just not worth it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316188,about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end    i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel    alas    br    br   those who like gus van sant s films   especially his later ones   will probably like this  personally  i find van sant s films to be dull  pretentious and facile  well  he was an executive producer for this film  so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him   although personally i actually liked this better than van sant s latest efforts  e g  elephant   br    br   contrary to many here  i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed  i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood   the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world   but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all  but i feel that the problem with the film is that  mood  is not enough    and not only that  but that the mood painted here is  to my mind  incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening  the dream like quality  so closely linked to nature  is beautifully captured here  but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child  one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold  waves on a beach  grasses and flowers  spiders etc   the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine  there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life  when you are caught up in a crush on someone   or being the object of bullying at school   you are anything but languorous  there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film   spoilers here   first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit  the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid   especially with no father present   seemed real to me  br    br   the second  and only part of the film with any tension to it  were the scenes where  leah   logan s re creation of himself  phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone sex  the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice over of  leah  was the most convincing actor in the entire film   it made me think of claire danes from my so called life    the voice even sounded like claire   she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids  and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along    it was perhaps the best moment in the film as   finally    we got some character development  br    br   all in all  a somewhat misplaced effort    we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director s possible talents  in the meantime  if he can get away from van sant s influence  it might do him a world of good  who is this director anyhow   one of van sant s boy toys

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490878,now  i m no film critic  but i truly hated  september 11   this film was  on a general basis  bad  with the exception of alejandro gonz lez i  rritu s segment  which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter  the short films were at best boring  and at worst offensive  the worst in my mind was youssef chahine s pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers  even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause  the segment was completely off topic and  considering chahine s seeming lack of any decency whatsoever  a waste of my time and patience  the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper  but in practice  it was tasteless

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409594,this is absurd   aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick  i can t help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra  considering how generous they were with their praise  br    br   admittedly i m not really a fan of comic book to movie conversions so i didn t go in with many expectations  yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming  the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained  that left you thinking  huh  what relevance does that have to the plot   or  so how did that aspect of the character come about   i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil  which i have no intention of seeing  br    br   furthermore  the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline  and don t even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot  i m also  still  scratching my head over the fate of cary hiroyuki tagawa s character  which seems to have gone by unexplained  br    br   if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot  but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra  i know we re supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films  but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing  even by action film standards  that it simply frustrated me  br    br   well  hell  at least jennifer garner looks damn good 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446313,i can t figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad  it s like the tv station are desperate for anything  anything at all  they re buried underneath a bunch of snow  the electricity constantly flashes on and off  yet magically there is a background light that stays constant  where does all this  fake  light come from  that  and all that stupid bickering between the characters  they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive  it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping  but because it s such bad directing and acting  you will not your florence nightingale fix with this flick  sorry  i m joining the negative feedback  and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304711,steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources  to pick on the technical flaws   silver f a 18s and f 14s take of from a carrier for an air strike  and miraculously become camouflaged f 16s for the actual strike   would give this movie more credibility than it deserves  suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe  which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro  putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119527,about five minutes in  and i saw where this was heading  bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the school s administration and thoughts of rebellion start fomenting  i said to my girlfriend  if it gets below a 5 on imdb  i ll go and read a book  it got 5 0  so she persuaded me to go on watching  what are the good things  well  it is a good thing this film does not have a story  because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing  it s like the student s drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers  all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meat grinder  and left half the stock destroyed  with the other half spliced into two second bits  even in a ten second scene of the local tv news  there are about six cuts and three different angles  and then there are the montages  these are all set to electronic music  which forewarns you of yet another montage  so that like pavlov s dog you start cringing every time you hear it  which is about every three minutes  oh  i was supposed to say what s good about this film  well  the film was shot very well  with a nice color palette  that nicely matched the emotional content   such as there was   of the scenes  okay  now with the film s major flaw  and it wasn t the story  or lack thereof  the director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations  not by clever storytelling  but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters  that s just cheating  i guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable  but it just became plain annoying  if the story is full of holes  it s no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer  and often there wasn t even any point to it  and then the ending  basically  the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy  if a coward  plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie  that you should stand up for a just cause on its head  by the already mentioned misdirection  and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions  that was already made  and much better  by animal farm  it also committed what i call the bill cosby sin  no matter how things may seem at first  in the end adults are always right  and children always wrong  and let s face it  unless you re me  that s just not true

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0867591,this seemed to be a good movie  i thought it would be a good movie  and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time  and yes  i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable  but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message  which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do  the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens  a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied  if indeed that was the director s intention  this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most  br    br   another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo typing of the american characters   they all seem to be carved out of the same block  seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie  br    br   these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210794,perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by nancy allen and linda farentino  c  thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here  while on marijuana  why did this need to be included  this weakened plot considerably   also farentino s charac  would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship  would does movie try to say  not much

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164912,i am not one of those who think king is a great writer  his books are fine distractions for a few hours  and often have interesting premises  however they  in my opinion  fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought  br    br   this film suffers from being a pretty exact re telling of king s story  if you have read the book  there are zero surprises  no changes  no altering of scenes or characters  this is a film made by king fans for king fans  br    br   for the rest of us  there is nothing terrible about the film  it is a  gypsy curse  horror  with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for  to become thinner  the final third has some severe structural problems  and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little  br    br   there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life  but you might as well read the book  because there is nothing new here    br    br

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081695,apparently none of the previous reviewers most of whom praise the film for its accuracy  have actually read a biography of louis pasteur the most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between pasteur and napoleon iii back in the 1930 s the latter was invariably shown in a bad light while far from an admirable character he was an inept politician and a self appointed  military genius  who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous war he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here  he had an intelligent interest in science and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring far from exiling pasteur  he was his patron building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research while the lab was under construction  pasteur became gravely ill a bureaucrat  deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead  ordered work halted on his own authority when the emperor heard about this  his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck passing  and work promptly resumed the emperor personally visited pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab the emperor would often bring members of his court to admire pasteur s projects and it was obvious to everyone that pasteur was one of the emperor s favorites pasteur s main worry concerning the emperor was that napoleon thought pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything  and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience pasteur  a very modest man  was always protesting this  but napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him and pasteur despite his misgivings  always came through they always had a close and friendly relationship and after the emperor was overthrown  pasteur refused to say a bad word about him grateful to the end of his life  br    br   the part about his daughter having the baby  and pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor  never happened the part about the anthrax and rabies  for which he was famous  is generally correct  but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false he was famous and respected at the time this happened this movie is ok from a dramatic standpoint but very distorted as biography

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783501,this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line  bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event  there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane  i believe that mister bin would play it better  generally speaking  film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie  stauffenberg  from 2004  but can t get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever  however  movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171842,a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon  then other parts felt like some other movie  i don t know which  but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie  it was kind of nice to watch  but it would have been fantastic  if the story would have been more original  the theme little girl  bad assassin from leon  is just tweaked a little  the opening scenes are really good     it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen  in the movies     my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon  nikita and if they where from the french or american version  if you have not seen leon  then this is a good movie  if you liked this movie  then i can recommend leon  br    br   best regards  rick
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195234,caught part of george 2 on tv recently  but couldn t get myself to watch it through to the end  just awful  i can t even remember the plot  all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie  which was bad enough  there s a lot of scrambling around  but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy  it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes  having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this  george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen  and that is saying something  jeez  because of imdb s 10 lines rule  i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made for tv sequel  disney  hang your head in shame 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119690,there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned  one either likes it very much  applauding its sincerity  its liberal point of view and fine acting  or else loathes its obvious propaganda  mediocre dialogue  cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness  i fall very much in the latter category  and found the film and play   concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime  a crushing bore  worthwhile mostly for the acting  and even then only intermittently  that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant  her plays were written for people who shared her point of view  and she seldom explored ideas that weren t already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the  other side  is  even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say   as in rhine  i still can t stand the way she says it  her characters are unreal  and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality  she really had nothing new to say  i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy s long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago  for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days  i urge a peek at watch on the rhine  as bad in its way as angels in america  which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780595,after watching this film  i was left with a two very annoyances about this film  why did they make chen s character this  mcguyver hit man  and lee s character such an incompetent idiot  chen s character s background is that he was raised in an underground cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild  dogs   this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive  he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt  soon after this scene  he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant  not only is he uneducated  he is starving  this is not a reference to chen s scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food  one of which  being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship  si in the first ten minutes of the film  it is established that chen is malnutrition ed  unmodernized and has only thing going for him  his  dog  brawling fighting style of some sort  despite this situation  chen manages to out shoot every policeman  even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head  whom was holding chen s girlfriend hostage  and has somehow attained a super human strength  swings a 50 lb block of concrete  plastered on the end of a metal pipe  to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest  by said chief   br    br   now lee s character   okay  i get it  he s depressed  he s got some baggage  but wow  can he do anything right  one moment  they try to make him cool  composed and ready to take care of business  and the next moment  he just got beat again  first scene he runs into chen  and he manages to misses him  from approx 15 ft  multiple times  toward the end of that scene  lee watches chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds  while holding a gun to chen face  at a 10 ft distance  even at the end of the movie  lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again  br    br   and my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with chen s character and that he is just  killing to survive   that would be a lot easier if i didn t just watch chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie  of the numerous people he killed  only two people had the intention of trying to kill him  the police chief and lee  others were just people who were eating  boat owners  taxi drivers  and policemen trying to arrest him  not kill  overall  chen s character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants  even if its just a free ride   did i mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film   my 3 stars go to some of the interesting director camera work who got in some nice shots  br    br   bottomline  one made for the nut hugging chen fans  for me   dog bite this dvd 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097981,there s a lot of movies that have set release dates  only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind  and then put in limbo for a long time  you can only wish a film as rotten as  slackers  remained in a coma for what it s worth  which is miniscule  release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves  the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan  a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela  ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela  i don t like to give spoilers out  but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception  angela falls for david  ethan intentionally screws everything up  the good guys win  that s what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre  gross humor is funny  it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic  animal house   to the likes of contemporaries like  there s something about mary  and  road trip  amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention  but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far  case in point  ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it  no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself  no one wants to watch a young man singing  she ll be coming around the mountain  with a sock on his penis  but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50 s bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old  i don t know if it s the story s lack of coherence  which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense  director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer  and after reviewing this film  you can only wish he ll go back to the profession  the worst thing you can do on any film  is to make it look like you re having fun  because you detract from your objectives  just like  slackers  does  by burying it s plot outline under a pile of gross out gags  pointless vignettes  and lack of construction  it s like a bunch of college students got drunk  took one s camcorder  and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together  if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that s actually good  then i suggest  american pie  and  animal house   or  road trip   just something that s entertaining  and not dreadfully bad like  slackers   coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film  just as she did in another bad film such as  the sweetest thing  where the story treats gross humor like another plot  instead of a device much like this disaster   if you pass by  slackers  at your local video store  just keep on walking  and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063794,watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me  it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the  non action   and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo croat indie and find them fascinating  br    br   the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over orchestrated  one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue  apart from the set pieces where characters  collide  in a very structured setting  to make this work  the film needed to feel more conceptual  which it didn t   this leads to a lack of realistic character development  everyone seems two dimensional  br    br   the worse for this is the character of bill spear  aka snoop dogg  i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic  at one point  i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character s aggressive  violent and monotonal delivery  the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary  on  switch  which gets really predictable after a while  and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities  however  one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film  supposedly 70s  it feels and looks more early noughties   if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s  his character might have seemed more understandable  br    br   the lighting of the film was also awkward  all the way through  the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty  jazz infused atmosphere that just did not come off  largely because the set was too well lit  br    br   the tenants  to me  is an unbelievable film  it doesn t depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race  identity or the life of a writer  be they white or black  br    br   strangely  i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch  his eerie  clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494192,elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community  and while it was a very interesting idea in concept  in reality it has failed miserably  br    br   the film is beautifully rendered  which is probably the only redeeming factor  a huge problem with them  however  is the vast overruse of light bloom  it s horrible  although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality  br    br   one thing to note is the terrible voice acting  while proog s voice actor is at least semi competent  emo s voice actor is horrible  i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero  you can t afford to hire real voice actors  to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice  br    br   as a whole  the movie doesn t really go anywhere  to me it seems like it s more of a  look what we can do  kind of movie instead of a real film  the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point  the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas  br    br   overall  it may be worth a quick download from the official site  but don t expect anything except pretty graphics

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309,at one point  violet  lucy liu  tells neil  cillian murphy  that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure  she said  because i m bore phobic   it mean that she can t really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities  well  i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic  because  watching the detectives  is a cheer boredom   br    br   have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once  neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop  he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward  but neil s life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store  she s an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him  anyway  after some dates  they decide to see each other  the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can t really doing something normal  whereas neil is completely opposite to hers  the question is  is they are going to be in love at the end  you bet  br    br    watching the detectives  is a clich  romantic comedy to its core  and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else  from the first couple of set up  we know that neil is pretty laid back guy who didn t really commit to anything  and then  violet enters the scene  looking all weird and annoying  so at this point  we all know that we re going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they re going to end up in the end  is it worth waiting for  i would say no  br    br   as i said  they tried to give something more for the audience   watching the detectives  is trying to talk about commitment  to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire  we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart  or whatever   well  i think it is completely bullshit  this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself  forget about it  that girl is one of a nutjob    after collaborating with many great directors recently  danny boyle s  sunshine  and  28 days later   ken loach s  the wind that shakes the barley  and neil jordan s  breakfast on pluto  to name a few   it s pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop  paul soter  by all means  he s not bad  as usual   but such a talent actor like him shouldn t be wasting his time in the movie like this  on the other hand  lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet  her acting is a mess  i mean it s all over the place and so over the top  tony montana would have been proud  br    br   the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title  you simply can t really connect a dot between the plot and its title  and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all  in short   watching the detectives  is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn t imagine  br    br   bloodymonday rating  1 5 4
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086543,there are just so many things wrong with this movie  br    br   to begin with  the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten  the overall movie is  mercifully  short already  but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the mean lion  how did the miss a reference to  the wiz  on that one   and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot  in short  the script had the seed of a good idea  but needed quite a bit of reworking  br    br   second  it could have done without the crude humor  the original also had some that it could have done without  but at least there it was almost an afterthought    here  flatulence and urination abound  br    br   third  the show is a little too self aware  the original series had that well enough  as did the first movie  but here it s just way  way too much  the brendan fraser in jokes were just a bit over the top  and why no mention of the  new ursula     other gags with the narrator  especially a couple of interactions near the end  also exceed good sense  br    br   fourth  a bit more attention could have been given to the cgi work  in the first it was hard to tell that shemp wasn t a real elephant  except by behavior  of course   but here the cgi stands out like a sore thumb  ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they re good or bad  and they at least do succeed on that count  so it s a relatively small problem  but it s still there  br    br   all that said  christopher showerman s performance as george is decent enough  it lacks brendan fraser s charm  but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison    he even managed to give george a bit of personal depth  which should have been a major foul in a jay ward inspired movie but wasn t here  julie benz as the new ursula surprised me as being even better than leslie mann in the original  br    br   most other performances were pretty standard  not standing out in my mind as either good or bad 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486583,warning  possible spoilers  not that you should care  also  sorry for the caps   br    br   starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that s all the more annoying for talking nonsense  it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama  that s badly but accurately put  br    br   we know space travel is a risky enterprise  there s a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions  radiation  stress related symptoms etc  and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments  they knew stuff could go wrong  in fact  stuff had gone wrong  it s called learning  granted  appollo 11 wasn t safe by today s standards and there was immense political pressure  but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive  br    br   assorted mistakes comments i hadn t even to look up  br    br   1  nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong  well duh  that s what i would ve done  it was the apex of a propaganda war  after all  br    br   2  nasa gives green light despite the fact that appollo 11 will probably blow up   this is  only  implicit  though   yeah  that s why they let people and press watch in almost real time  br    br   3  the capsule ejection wouldn t work  like it didn t work the time a chimp was in it  the one that survived  it was a test launch and the rocket exploded  the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute  there s a video of it  you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere  br    br   4  one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida  i can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole   cause if not  i m just aghast how he could get it so wrong  br    br   5  the technology then was primitive compared to today s standards  actually  relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today  the reason being that it must not crash  it s even worse for spacecraft  because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren t that susceptible to radiation   and the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway  so a complex steering system like the b2 s wouldn t do   what s with the fact that they were using  tv screens  rather than  computer screens   it s the same damn technology  actually tv monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition  br    br   6   if that object wasn t part of the rocket  it could be only one thing   we see where this is going  apart from the fact that the statement is wrong  who says it wasn t a rocket part  at least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don t know what it is  it s by definition an unidentified flying object  br    br   7  the voice over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander s radiation foil was actually its hull  which would make it thinner than a space suit  br    br   8  neil armstrong s near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate  i hadn t seen it before  as i said  any piece of manifest technology can go wrong  especially if it s not been tested sufficiently on account of being  you know  unprecedented  br    br   9 the trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander  due to irregularities in the moon s density  was at no time acutely life threatening  neither was the  fifteen seconds of fuel left   which was  in fact   fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module   br    br   10  a  catastrophic chain of events  usually results in catastrophe  i really don t know how to put it any simpler  this  however  is a prime example of the rhetoric used  br    br   11  there s a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid  followed by the voice over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior  can now be revealed   turns out  he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid  hilarious stuff  br    br   12  it s mentioned that during re entry  all contact was lost  this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it s impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology  again  the gravity of this is implicit  but very purposely so  br    br   13  there was never a shuttle lost in space itself  while the voice over presents this  fact  as evidence that appollo 11 was a pile of crap  appollo 13 was a near loss  but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re entry  respectively  in any case  comparing shuttles to saturn rockets is somehow     well  okay  just plain stupid  even ignoring that  the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience  br    br   14  what the hell s up with the ufo  even in the context of the movie  it makes no sense  unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes  aimed at a specific audience  which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history  science  or rhetorics   br    br   even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure  catch phrases like  covered up until now    publically revealed here for the first time   come up  but the film doesn t place any blame or offer a lesson or anything  which could be expected of a film so emotionally done  in the good old tradition of sensationalism  there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except  nasa scientist   wow  so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor  fancy that  what does this have to do with the point of the movie again  oh yeah  which point  br    br   in summary  in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate  it s not even good entertainment  and believe me  i m a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries  this film isn t funny  witty  quaint  it s nothing 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052646,a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread  br    br   i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it  mandatory  or  compulsory   br    br   i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing  br    br   the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to  do right   it appeals particularly to more  liberal  leaning people because it doesn t have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to  be good  going  br    br   and that s the problem with the film  al gore is a politician  and a very successful one at that  he just can t help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would  the political appeal is just too great  br    br   and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance  reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to  do right   br    br   another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295529,this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlin s best  the story is pretty routine stuff  but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive  in fact  the ghost story is almost an afterthought  the real horror comes from the prison setting itself  and renny h  spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling  leaking  rat infested old hellhole  with a sadistic warden  too   viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role  supported by some very authentic looking prisoners  there are no pretty boys in this cast   horror fans should check this one out

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040331,i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old  my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for  5 on vhs  she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch  this movie  however  scared the hell out of me  you may be asking yourself  how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone  the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions  pitch  to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas  that s right  satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause  pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day  for if santa doesn t make it back to his home in space  he turns to powder  don t get me wrong  the movie is funny and fairly entertaining  however  the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell  which occurs at the beginning of the movie  is just downright creepy

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328802,i couldn t bear to sit through he entire movie  do families like this really exist somewhere  there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such  and i think that that is a great description of how they behaved  br    br   more absurdly unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as  pigface  who  of course  has grown into a drop dead gorgeous 20 year harvard educated plastic surgeon  but only to do good in the world not for the money   and she beds steve carrel on the first date  that s when i quit watching    br    br   if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours  then perhaps you ll enjoy this sentimental  self indulgent waste of time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150255,scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick  tim young  is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers   fellow students alike  the poor kid suffers daily humiliation  bullying  teasing   general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers  unfortunately he doesn t find much support at home since his mom is a slut   after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field   strangles the poor kid  however something magical happens  no  the film doesn t suddenly become good   lester s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him   made his life hell    br    br   co written  co produced   directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr  duforq although i don t remember any character of this name  i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it s terrible reputation   i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it s terrible  the script by itier  bill cunningham   jason white uses the often told story of one of life s losers who gets picked upon   tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick  we ve seen it all before  we ve seen killer scarecrows before  we ve seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before  we ve seen one of life s losers get his revenge before  we ve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before   we ve seen incompetent small town sheriff s make matters even worse before  the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it s any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level  the answer is a resounding no to be honest  the film has terrible character s  awful dialogue  an inconsistent   predictable story  it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask s  can you dig it     the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame  the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn t that exciting   the kills are forgettable  you know i m still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed   killed with a stick of corn    br    br   director itier doesn t do a particularly good job here  the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there s never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off  also i m not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips   somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix  1999  or some japanese kung fu flick  to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good   he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners   twirl around a bit  don t you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring  i know he s a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day  there s no nudity   the gore isn t anything to write home about  there s a decapitation  someones face is burnt  someone is killed with a stick of corn  someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat  some sickles are stuck in people s heads  someone has their heart ripped out   someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth  br    br   with a supposed budget of about  250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days  well at least they didn t waste any time on unimportant things like story   character development  technically this is pretty much point  shoot   hope for the best stuff  if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing    the acting sucks  the guy who played lester s mum s bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig   fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film   the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous   don t get me started on his accent    br    br   scarecrow has a few fun moments   the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made  badly acted  silly  too predictable   very cheesy  if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows  1988   not to be confused with the gene hackman   al pacino film scarecrow  1973  or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow  2008  which is currently in production  scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels  scarecrow slayer  2003    scarecrow gone wild  2004

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115834,this movie made me very angry  i wanted desperately to throttle the  scientists  and unseen film makers during the course of it  very  very painful to sit through  sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way  the little good information on brain function chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh t  the worst offenders were the crack pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza  mr  dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he  on the other hand  is living on a higher plane  even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed  clumsy  superior  pretentious  preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them  i think that s what made me so angry  the fact that they ve taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum  much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world  fittingly  the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clich  ridden  br    br   i would refer people instead to bill bryson s excellent survey of science   a brief history of nearly everything   there s plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual  established science 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272202,this is an interesting idea gone bad  the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing  but the execution in  anamorph  is excruciatingly slow and without much interest  there is no other way to describe the film except boring  the death clues are the only interesting part of  anamorph   everything connecting them is tedious  willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator  but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit  several supporting character actors are wasted   including peter stormare as the art expert  james rebhorn as the police chief  paul lazar as the medical examiner  and most notably deborah harry  who is featured on the back of the dvd case  yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door  not recommended    merk

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128239,in spite of the great future design touches  the clever asimov premise  and will smith s dependable cool performance  this movie doesn t live up to expectations  the clich s come thick and fast   waking from a recurring nightmare  maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant  to list more would be spoiling it   you can see the end a mile off   this movie is also stagebound   you never feel that you have travelled anywhere  what s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago  the robots themselves are good in closeup  but the  crowd  scenes look more like bad disney  the cgi is overdone again and again  and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them  why do they need to inject  nanites   you know it s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax  it could have been great  but it s less than the sum of its parts  mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095684,i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing  as i am  you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck  the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early  and embarrassing  footage  it s as if the producers of laugh in sat down and decided to write a full length film  covering all the high points  and more  of the issues between the flower children and the establishment  then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a  10 000 budget to complete it  hardly a classic  but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was  the silliness  the over idealism  and the uptightness of the establishment  clearly not for everyone 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067,i remember a certain tuesday  the morning of 18 6 02 to be exact  i was dozed off  trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard  i went to the kitchen where i have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point  the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens  i remember rushing to my bedroom  taking out my binoculars  racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus  the bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a tnt device  murdered 25 passengers  many of whom were on their way to school  the wife of a good friend of mine  sat on the bus at the back row  a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life  br    br   i m sure that every israeli has at least one terror related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it  as it turned out  the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own  br    br   the film is about a play write on a dry run  haim buzaglo  portrayed by  hmmm  haim buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film  that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page  in the meantime  his girlfriend  a field reporter for the israeli commercial channel  decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex army officer  buzaglo  bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the  what on earth this hot babe is dating me  syndrome  asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend  br    br   as the detective progresses in his investigation  his observations are permeating into the play and later on  to the lives of its actors  in the meantime  the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the israeli society  as for the movie  well  the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing  ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place  br    br   when i say  cardboard characters  i refer to the characters that under the writer director s obsession for a  meaningful  film  were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability  i won t elaborate too much about it  suffice to say that i m sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater  with the intention to see a play  that is  br    br   this movie  according to haim buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy  i sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one i wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling  br    br   4 out of 10 in my filmometer  br    br   p s  this movie was a landmark in austerity  it was shot in ten days  all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about 12 000   no  i didn t omit a zero or two  twelve thousand dollars   makes you wonder why it took 34 000  to complete blair witch project 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038363,scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately  such as minotaur or dog soldiers   grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf  however  it deviates so much  and offers so little in comparison  that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it  some shitty christopher lambert movie   i wasn t expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production  but i did however expect the  artistic integrity  to not interfere with the actual story  even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots   br    br   did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing  did any research go into this    obviously not  as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew  save for mullet boy  are wearing  one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendelif beowulf is supposed to wrestle him  shouldn t he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons  grendel s death segment was also lacking in every way   in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script  for example  grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf   not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs  and grendel s motherdid they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds  and honestly  what the hell was with that mullet   br    br   if you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic don t  as there really isn t one  other than character names   the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie druids  directed by jacques dorfmann    although i don t recommend watching either

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174336,not that  a film by ulli lommel  filled me with hope  but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations  there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects  which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock  but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid  the effect is never perfect  but it helps  unfiltered digital video really only works for the  mockumentary  style  because it never looks like anything other than video  therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer  watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer  it does not feel like watching a movie  and what s even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker  he ought to know better  he ought to know that it s virtually impossible to generate horror  or even suspense   on video  for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties  he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business  and lucky us  he wrote the script too  so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing  unjustified behavior  and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied  please  please miss this film  you ll thank me later

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096462,confounding melodrama taken from a william gibson story  produced by john houseman and directed by vincente minnelli  richard widmark heads up posh  upscale rural nervous asylum  where his loose wife battles with self appointed queen bee lillian gish  and widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff newcomer lauren bacall  who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child  facetious and muddled  set in an indiscriminate time and place  and with a  david and lisa  love story hidden in the plush morass  widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together  but this script gives them nothing to build on  for precisely an hour  most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library  this thread isn t used as symbolism  rather it s a red herring in a non mystery    the picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they re working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right  but unfortunately the roundabout way minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative  enlightening nor entertaining     from

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926129,two years ago at sundance i loved josh kornbluth s directing debut haiku tunnel  so i was looking forward to his brother  and frequent collaborator  jacob s  the best thief in the world  this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower class area of new york  the movie is not without its poignant moments  but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious  life can be very difficult for some people  and life isn t fair  br    br   more subtle  and more important  is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti social behavior they may spawn  these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity  we can recoil at their language and their living conditions  but we are cannot discount their intent  and in fact  their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate  kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood  and his compassion for the people is evident throughout  br    br   having said all this  the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws  including the title   the characters aren t very believable  the writing is uneven  and the plot line is barely discernible  and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes  to each his own  but while i don t question the potential realism of this phenomenon  it pains me to see 5 year old children mf ing and talking about having sex with a line up of women  it s unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101413,primal species  1996  dir  jonathan winfrey   br    br   international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs  the army commando team now have to think fast  if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species  instead of the reptiles  br    br   you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film  that is pretty much it  the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters  the story is poor  with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs  this film came out three years after  jurassic park   instead  this film looks to have come out 13 years before  jurassic park   the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made  and i do mean costumes  there are obviously people dressed up  and this film makes no attempts at hiding this  a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way  in which it looks like someone is riding the creature  the is one good thing  which comes out of this film  the short running time  at only 1 hour and 15 minutes  it doesn t waste too much of your life  but still try to avoid it altogether  br    br    it s like a friday the 13th nightmare     officer  brian currie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154443,we see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl  but whatever he tries they won t stay open  after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret  but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways  through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group  but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences  so  is she back from the grave seeking revenge   br    br   oh what a great and always spooky story  well  that s what i hoping i could say  and  hoping  was as good as it got  this is an forgettable  so so supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before  but i went in thinking it was my first viewing  so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things  but like i said it s quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again   nightmare  is just another type of it s field that adds a  few  changes to the gruel  oh  please give me something that s a bit more fresh  it doesn t have to be entirely original  but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired j horror flick  even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking  vengeful chick spirit  br    br   but in spite of my negativity of it being the same old  same old story and jolts  this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals  the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality  while  the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it s murky lighting  the first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood curdling experience  but really when it s not trying to shock you  i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shut eye  that might be harsh  but it just didn t go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments  you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one  the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self centred bunch that you don t really care what happens to them  the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship  it just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it s just plain ludicrous  the film s haunting ending is a high point  though  br    br   the film looks fine  although it could have done without the snazzy  quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood  the performances tread a fine line  but gyu ri kim is strong in the lead role  br    br   it s nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas  but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills  although  i found the handling of it rather lethargic  despite the odd effective chills  a standard effort all round i guess  but still it s equally missable

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893509,    or maybe it just is this bad  the plot is a cheap rehash of the first  which is weird  since it s supposed to be a prequel  not a sequel  pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first  with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first  only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely  where the first had a great cast  this one consist of b list actors and rejects  the acting is mostly horrendously bad  half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first  as is nearly every major character  including the ones who weren t in the first movie  i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode  but that s no excuse  they didn t have to turn the  bad  footage into a movie  only one thing is marginally good  and that s the erotic sequences  however  as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first  even this isn t raising it above a rating of 1  if you have a chance to see it for free  and you re a straight guy  it could be worth checking out  if you want something erotic that isn t porn  if not  avoid at all costs  1 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366292,one of the worst films i have seen to date  pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help  the only good point is gary busey s parts but this does not lift the film very much  it lives up to its b film ranking and passes the test with flying colours  a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches  i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift    a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete refund   br    br   really bad  br    br   1 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000,en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track  but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway   a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination  the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area  in the first story  an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband  but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie  and in the second story  a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on  br    br   the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea  but with only two stories  it falls woefully short  and that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver  the acting is lousy  with joe haggerty  as the tale telling ebenezer jackson  giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen   the locations are uninspired  the script is dreary  there s a sex scene with zero nudity  and the ending     well  that beggars belief  br    br   to be fair  some of sykes  creative camera work is effective  although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused  and joe castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic  an ear is bitten off  eyeballs are plucked out  a face is removed  brains are squished  and there is a messy decapitation  these positives just about make the film bearable  but be warned  the zombie chronicles ain t a stroll in the park  even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash  br    br   i give the zombie chronicles 2 10  but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn t get to view the film with the benefit of 3d  although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn t have made that much of a difference  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211181,i just want to make one thing clear  i love michael vartan  but this film really lets him down  his acting is still superb  he s still as charming as ever  and he still looks great  but the film itself is a load of rubbish  natasha henstridge  i m sorry to say it  comes over bit manly    you re constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend  who s own sub storyline is a little weird  myself and my family  who sat down and watched the film with me  were also put off by the soundtrack to the film  at times the music just didn t fit with what was going on in the scenes  however  even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film  i could forgive the leading lady s butch ness  i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix  and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment  but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end    the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold  if you re a michael vartan fan skip this film  buy yourself a poster instead 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117589,this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since  oh  i don t know  whats happening now  nothing ever happened on this ridiculous  series   even though it s mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves  you don t get any good details into their personal lives  it s mostly just them making stupid  jokey small talk and acting like white trash  look  i love britney s music as much as the next babe  but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails  yes  that could be an actual episode   thank god these two broke up  because they were painfully dull together  this show is toxic 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063665,this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle  the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw  fishburne  and the usually solid ed harris  connery seems miscast as a harvard academic  the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along  it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels  the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast  george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty  the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree  the scripting and direction are extremely poor  connery s charisma and screen presence are the film s only virtue  manipulative  violent  and ridiculous  2 10 avoid it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177876,not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot  during the whole film  i was like   erm   what is this movie all about  i don t get the animations at all  probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s  during the film  there is a group of people walked out  after the movie  many people said   that s it   frankly speaking  i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award  if you are thinking of watching this film  i strongly recommend you not to  you will regret it  i m not joking  you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138322,i just finished reading a book on anita loos  work and the photo in tcm magazine of macdonald in her angel costume looked great  impressive wings   so i thought i d watch this movie  i d never heard of the film before  so i had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever  thought it got off to a cute start with eddy as the playboy and macdonald as the secretary he doesn t know exists  the scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won t stay on was really endearing  i was even with the film when eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel  but after a while it just started to fall apart for me  eddy stays  asleep  for the entire rest of movie  so it s all a dream  whatever happens from there on doesn t really matter  because he s just dreaming  the rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless  i had to force myself to stick with it  and the final number where macdonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky  br    br   had eddy  woken  a sooner and the original story continued  or had he really married an angel  i think it would have been a lot more interesting  i wanted to see more of her real character  br    br   there weren t really enough musical numbers to call it a musical  the first few songs were good  but the jitterbug number that macdonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard  completely wrong for her operatic voice  even so  eddy and macdonald still manage to shine  showing what true stars they were 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112740,serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind  instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains  the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems  there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters  the mad doctor s nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy  the results are not good  this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors  there isn t much zombie action in this one and the effects  while adequate  are nothing special  you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes  watch out for some nudity and bad language

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102116,the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep  engaging  powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show  among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well acclaimed play  the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation  which comes as a double edged sword  on one hand  who better to translate the play than the original writer  on the other hand  who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself  doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense  with a frustrating ending  unnecessary dialogue  questionable directing  and of course  the inability to provide substantial answers  it is a growing trend among these  high caliber  films to not answer all questions it provides  and this has to stop  br    br   doubt is like a joke without its punch line  like a book with the final 20 pages missing  like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game  and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next  doubt  just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men  doesn t really end  it doesn t provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending  yes  that was the intent  but this isn t a test of humanity  it s a cop out  i do not pay money to see an unfinished work  i pay money to see a beginning  middle  and end  and pray that i don t fall asleep during the three acts  we are forced to become the  writers  of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other  br    br   this little drama is about a nun  meryl streep  who seems very sure that the well beloved priest  philip seymour hoffman  is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church  the first african american boy in the catholic church  the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone s backs  the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently  which attracts the notice of a young teacher  amy adams   the story is set right after the assassination of john f  kennedy  which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other  br    br   doubt s strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over  streep seems to be oscar worthy in every role she s in  and here she is no different as her sternness and cold hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church  hoffman excels yet again as the priest  by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura  the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off  especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time  but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers  when these two argue  you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched  but let s not forget amy adams  enchanted  and viola davis  law ad order  for their superb job either  doubt s casting ensemble is among the best in 2008  br    br   yet  like previously stated it s the writing and directing that ruins this film  especially when dwindling down the third act  questions pop up  but they aren t answered  characters pop up  but provide no real enhancement towards the plot  kids behave different  but we never truly find out why  there are awkward angles in the camera workandthere s no actual reason why  john patrick shanley  the writer of the play  had one previous film in his directing repertoire  joe versus the volcano  whether sheer arrogance or stupidity  we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation  utter annoying chatter that bores to no end  there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted  thanks to mr  shanley  br    br   bottom line  the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that s just as irritating as the seizureific camera work in action films  it doesn t matter that we have a great talented acting cast  or decent cinematography  or a good story being worked upon  or good usage of sound and music  because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn t even finish  the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate  because we have the original madmen behind the project but he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well  this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end  sideways  cast away  no country for old men  burn after reading are a few examples  br    br   newsflash  end your stinkin  movie  please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank  like wall e s depressing backstories   instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness  confusion  and mental anguish  have a beginning  middle  and the end please   as a critic  i prefer my films to be whole  not incomplete  doubt feels incomplete  which is why it gets an incompetent grade  br    br   someone has to break this stupid trend 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818095,shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role  elizabeth shue is a commendable actress  why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity  i must give credit where credit is due  though  some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing  but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon s character  sebastian caine  i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone  man or woman  that has any form of self respect to account for

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116762,i feel the movie did not portray smith historically  the goal of this movie was to tell smith s life in a way that would be  comfortable  to the lds church leaders  historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern  the movie was designed to be a  faith promoting  experience  not a balanced view of smith  as a man   i have taken it upon myself to study smith s life and have read both lds works and none lds works  the movie  like most lds projects  was beautifully filmed and well acted  however  this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smith s relatively short life  br    br   a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven  while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook  it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith  another point is in portraying smith s teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family s involvement in magical practices during the 1820 s  another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good naturedly entering into wrestling contests  it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent  br    br   i could go on and on  this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man  i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145660,i am a shakespeare fan  and i can appreciate what ken branagh has done to bring shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers  however  this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences  add that with alicia silverstone s stumbling over the dialogue  reminiscent of keanu reeves in much ado about nothing  and other poorly cast roles  it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062288,this is the second british rank film to adapt the stories of sommerset maugham to film  all but one story from  quartet  does not travel well into the contempory era  and the actors speech is decidedly  clipped   as only british pre 1950 s actors delivery can be  in anycase  trio  seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation  br    br   one of the problems these two films can t overcome is that their source material was written 25 30 years prior to the films  consequently  by the 1950 s maughm s  pre war  popularist  small morality  storyteling seemed rather quaint  if not downright coy

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097981,utter dreck  i got to the 16 minute 27 second point  and gave up  i d have given it a negative number review if that were possible  although  pissible  is a more fitting word      unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original  the chemistry between dumb ol  dicky crenna and whats her face here is just non existent  the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet  there s no ciggy lighting by fingertip  and i thought i d be sick when they have a mortified looking  and rightly so  believe you me  lee j  cobb as keyes practically burping upchucking his way through the explanation of his  little man  to mr  garloupis  no offence to the non sighted  but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses  the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears  and crikey  how much    does neff make  that he lives overlooking a huge marina  this  folks  again  all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes  if you can get through more of it  you have a much stronger constitution than me  or you are a masochist  but please  take some alka seltzer first  or you will develop a  little man  of your own that may never go away  proceed with caution  obviously 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191915,this movie was terrible  at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok  so i watched it  the acting was terrible  it was like the actor were almost camera shy  everything seemed fake  i feel bad for edward furlong  terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago   i ve watched it at least 20 times     br    br   the plot was also crap  the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines  br    br   on the plus side  it s the good kind of bad movie  the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get  so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was  br    br   i think everybody should watch this  so that then we could appreciate better other  real  movies 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084096,overall an extremely disappointing picture  very  very slow build up to the basic storyline  the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past   every take seems to last forever  there is really no rhythm in the film      spoilers    her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis  by a german woman  played by katja riemann  the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional  so stereotypical     spoilers end    the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something  please when you do that  give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place  there is never a clear indication of time   very annoying  worst part is  the end     spoilers    the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented  simply by a bureaucratic accident  give me a break  that s how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse  the question of who freed the jews is never answered  was is goebels who freed them  did lean fischer sleep with goebels  in venice the film won an acting award for k  riemann  why    i have no idea  must be the jewish theme
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103336,this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians  sandra locke   colleen camp  appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning  seymour cassel   in hope of help in locating a residence they can t seem to find  but these two have other plans in mind  when they find out george s wife is out of town  they end up taking control of the residence  tying up the george  killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening  bizarre and disturbing movie  but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends  most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it  either way some even consider this a cult classic  br    br   larry dodson
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484437,if you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so  then it s ok to watch this  it s not all that bad  really  yeah  it s got more lapses in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people   like myself  i have to admit   who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion  but it s funny at least  just because it s not always intentionally funny  there s no need to let that get you down  br    br   however  if you ve read the book   or any of the other books by brookmyre   then you d probably best avoid it  i ve read them all and when i first watched this film  i despised it  i ve trashed it in detail and at great length on another site  in fact  the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful  and admittedly rabid  brookmyre fans  br    br   best bit of advice    watch this  then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252028,if you re watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about  then you re in for quite the surprise  even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline  but the actual film is anything but  br    br   as the synopsis went  it tells of an obsessed mountain climber  which you ll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl  which tells you of the presence of chronopolis  an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind  note to self   this spells trouble with flashing lights   where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence  they can see our world  and notice of all persons this mountain climber  and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy  creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man  br    br   what that translated to  is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce  have shapes created  though credit goes to the stop motion style  and put it through a mind numbing loop  and repeat until your eyes start to close  then move on to the next scene  if anything  the chonopolisians  if this term exists  really love their sticks and balls  constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere  and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the  other  world  it gets no better as well  when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence  br    br   thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what s advertised  which is 57 minutes  or less  against the 70 stated  while firmly dated  its dull colours  non existent story  scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans  don t waste time 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097529,lol  not a bad way to start it  i thought this was original  but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong  i never saw king kong until i was 15  i saw this film when i was 9  the film s funky disco music will get stuck in your head  not to mention the film s theme song by the yetians  this is the worst creature effects i ve ever seen  at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b movies  memorable quotes   take a tranquilizer and go to bed    put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power   i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira  there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse  in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building  but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl  who was falling   also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man  1977  which came from hong kong  there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts  this film will leave you laughing  it is like i said  just another king kong clone  rated pg for violence  language  thematic elements  and some scary scenes 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117283,i can sit through this movie once  but i doubt i could make it through a second time  mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan  the fun of matt dillon think something about mary   and the re emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton  this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable  one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part  i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me  go see this with your little ones  i e  the  single digit bracket  kids and don t expect a lot from this film  br    br    x
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118643,it s nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman s ordered us forces into the korean war  starlift  you see  is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea  but you d need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name  korea  mentioned  we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there s no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured  which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america s men in uniform  released in december 1951 by warner brothers  starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio s star studded world war two home front morale booster  hollywood canteen   this 1944 crowd pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie  but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract  from joan crawford  john garfield  and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre  bette davis  sydney greenstreet and more  starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne  a mask like janice rule  and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops  but in place of crawford  garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day  ruth roman  gordon macrae  virginia mayo  gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney  randolph scott  and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper  this threadbare cast  whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp  is perfectly matched by the crummy production values  presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection  how bad is it  you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage  to describe starlift as a sloppy  lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy  lazy and third rate  it s just terrible  avoid it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445161,curiosity led me to this  masterpiece   unfortunately  i didn t rent it  i bought it  the most disturbing thing about this film is that it s not so disturbing  for reasons known only to them  the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer  are you kidding me  the man gave new meaning to the term  finger lickin  good   and with all the flash backs and flash forwards i had trouble following the story  all in all jeremy renner s performance wasn t too bad  you can catch him in  s w a t    in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop  anyway  i would rate this as a 1 10  it only got a 1 because of renner s so so performance  there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer s crimes  avoid this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120247,like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film  i was also waxing nostalgic about it   before i had the misfortune to actually watch it again  alas  my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy  and the perils of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal  racist  and plain boring film making  even the presence of old pros edward everett horton and terry thomas can t overcome a rancid screenplay  a horrible theme song  and some wretched  special effects   in addition  the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing  especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement  michael weldon s original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the perils of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release  judging from the results  that is a completely believable  and baffling  scenario 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460672,just recently  i ve been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that i almost had to see it  well  having just seen it today  the 5 8 rating is completely understandable  i think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need  it turns out not to be worth it   br    br   sure  the hills have eyes 2 has its moments  it has a very cool and well developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself  but the whole thing is so self indulged that it becomes so hard to follow  and if it weren t for wes craven s production on this film  it wouldn t be anything to do with the original remake   br    br   but the whole thing makes you go  is this supposed to be horror or comedy   because there are lots of ridiculous  randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners  i e   there s a hand in the sh  er   or  you motherfu  er  i ll kill you all damn sons of b  tches    and the acting  god don t even remind me how bad it was  br    br   storyline   this part contains spoilers  beware   the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby  ooh la la    and then the screen fades to black with the movie s title appearing  and a monologue  then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins  we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants  the box to keep track of audio feeds is gone  and everyone dies  after that tone setting opening  you d expect more  br    br   then  we go to this one team of military recruits training in baghdad  as the captain parades them  a good job at stupidity   their last day of training is in new mexico  the desert where the family in the last thhe had stayed because they were stuck  while in training  things go ultimately wrong  people die  and    do i need to tell you any more  because right now i have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this  br    br   the thing that s wrong with thhe2 is that it just dosen t work  no flashbacks here  and the ending is pretty safe    but with a twist  a stupid one  that is  i m pretty sure the ultra super director s cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of it s alternate endings  but at this point  i m not sure if i care   br    br   so by all means  if you loved the first thhe so much it s almost a sin not to see this  then by all means  see it  but if else  then  avoid at all costs  it s for your own good  br    br   3 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089645,emma is my favourite jane austen novel   emma is well meaning despite her flaws  so readers can forgive and love her  and the relationship she has with mr knightley  which is warm  familiar  respectful but playful  generating that warm  fuzzy  romantic excitement  mr knightley is the perfect man  and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent  clever  confident woman   remember  she is only 21  and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws  who doesn t want to be emma  who doesn t want to be told off by mr knightley  this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma  i couldn t even finish watching it  i just found it so awful  i couldn t see that warm  generous side of emma  which drives the reader to love her  the patience and warmth she shows to her father  the closeness between her and mrs weston  which demonstrates her willingness to put her friend s happiness above her own  as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding miss taylors marriage   mr woodhouse s character in this adaptation just appears bizarre  rather than just quaint  elderly and a bit trying  br    br   this adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma  their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection  mr knightley is indulgent of emma s minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray  and emma looks up to him  though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement  the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them  and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i ve described above  mr knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads  or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers   br    br   really horrible  i can t understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it  unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378947,this film was pure pain  sitting in the theater for x amount of minutes  i was wondering when the film was going to start  all the setups were in place  typical love story  characters have to overcome their short givings  villain has to emerge  but none of it ever initiated  by the time these things happened  i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective  in scenes that required immense tension and buildup  it felt like necessary frames were cut  kid s stuff does not have to be this way  children s films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones  the excuse   hey   its for kids   is bull  i ll take  sword in the stone  any day  this was terrible  i m getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days  and as for the kids  the 10 year i saw this with will agree   pure trash 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179443,i just got the uk 4 disc special edition of superman 1 for about  5  the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole men  so i slapped it into the dvd player last night  and here are my findings  br    br   some initial disappointment   i hadn t checked  and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials  i m not a huge fan of george reeves as superman  and i hadn t seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn   but hey ho  never mind  br    br   this black and white production runs for less than an hour  it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves  early tv series  a two parter  put together for cinema release  although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series  in any event  it s an odd choice for reasons i ll get to later  i m of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets  so there were no major surprises here  even so  for a low budget movie  this one is really low budget  br    br   the story concerns the small town of silsby   population 1 430   which  puzzlingly  is also home to the world s deepest oil well  6 miles   the story opens with the well s foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down  this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well  at the behest of the oil company  as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down  a couple of odd little guys  small in stature  big in head  black in jumpsuit  and bushy in eyebrow  emerge from the capped off drillshaft  and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces  br    br   a deep breath now  here is the remaining plot of the picture  the little guys scare some kids  so jeff corey  playing the town s rampant xenophobe  incites some pals to kill these  creatures   superman steps in  moderately ineffectually  and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital  corey s pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed  but he escapes and legs it down the shaft  corey incites a lynch mob  despite the sheriff arresting him  to hang the hospitalised mole man  superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows  a total of 4 mole men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey  i call this an aargh  gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go  aargh    and superman saves him  he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved  the mole men go back down the shaft  the end  br    br   despite the film only being an hour long  there is an inordinate amount of creeping around  bewareing and pursuing   i have left out all the  mole man 1 creeps from a to b  looking out to make sure no one is following him  stuff  the mole men are never engaged in any way whatsoever   they have no dialogue   they just turn up  get persecuted  and go back  they do look a little creepy  but they are hardly the bug eyed monsters that the town s reaction implies  br    br   reeves is quite a good clark kent   very much a hard nosed reporter  much more so than phyllis coates  rather indifferent lois lane  but he is a terrible  terrible superman  not only does he not look the part  at least his hair is dyed black in this  which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes   the way he plays it is all wrong in my book  i m sure he was told to  strike the pose   which superman does constantly   but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips  not fists on ribs  and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher   he doesn t actually wag his finger in remonstration  but he may as well have done  br    br   and superman does a huge amount of walking around  i say a huge amount   he isn t actually in it all that much   and a bit of running  he takes off and lands a couple of times  but isn t seen in flight at any point  oh  some bullets bounce off him  and he uses telescopic vision as clark  but with no accompanying visual effect  in fact  visual effects are conspicuous by their absence  and the few which are present aren t very good  br    br   i ve tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time  but even by those standards i think it s a pretty threadbare effort  thankfully  production standards on the tv series were higher  and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them  br    br   something of a disappointment   i shan t be watching it again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486321,i saw this film on its release  and have watched it 3 or 4 more times  including last week  i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr  branagh s performance  br    br   this is really a glorious  sumptuous film  to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long   beautifully shot and designed  derek jacobi  julie christie  kate winslet  richard briers  and many others do fine jobs  then there s kenneth branagh  if ever there was a vanity project for an actor  this is it  and mr  branagh spares nothing in putting the  ham  in hamlet  from the stunt casting  which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon   to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of  naturalness   to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others  his performance confirms that  while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary  he has never been a great film actor  the scenery budget could be charged to catering  mr  branagh eats so much of it  his performance is a perfect example of why people don t go to see shakespeare    full of sound and fury  signifying nothing   and if there is fault to his direction  it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance  br    br   no matter what theories people may posit on the bard  he was  after all is said and done  a playwright  the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless  although there is no  right  way to play his plays  there is most certainly great acting  good acting and bad acting  shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of  hamlet  itself  it amazes me how mr  branagh  mouthed  it  but did not hear it  it was an example of spending too much time working out how he s going to say something  and too little figuring out what he s saying  br    br   while mr  branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions  he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it  his direction has always been better than his acting  i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare  he set a great template for other productions  and  it would be interesting to see him onstage  from about 20 rows back  but  i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less  br    br   is it worth seeing  certainly  there are many little joys to be found in the film  but  it s a long  long movie and  by the end  one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190524,following the disasterous revolution  this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of goldcrest and thus the british film industry  the film is absolute pants  it s full of music from the attempted mid 80 s jazz revival and based on a book   author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity  temple searched for ages trying to find suzette and came up with 8th wonders patsy kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time  by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over  as was kensett s career and the film met a totally uncaring film public  br    br   mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst campest cheesiest acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308132,how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the  worst film of all time  by the  worst director of all time   a film that could develop a cult following because it s  so bad it s good   br    br   an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band wagon syndrome  let s bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it  and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we d cite  br    br   the film s universal poor quality goes without saying    sixteen years of alcohol  is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it  but i believe this film could go the distance  imdb doesn t allow enough words to cite all the films failures  and it be much easier to site the elements  sixteen years of alcohol  does right  unfortunately  those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film s poorness that that s a task not worth pursuing  br    br   my impressions  i thought i knew what i was getting into  i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one  wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka   despite my low expectations   sixteen years of alcohol  failed to entertain me even on a  make fun of the bad movie  level  not just bad  but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny      and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie  even after viewing the  sixteen years of alcohol  promotional literature  i have trouble believing jobson s sincerity  pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin chuckle moments  all i m sure none intentional spiced the film  and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off  so bad it s good  no  it had just enough  i can t believe this is a serious movie moments  to keep me from turning it off  and nothing more  br    br   definitely a film to watch with a group of bad movie connoisseurs  get your own running commentary going  that would ve significantly improved the experience for me  so bad it s mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs  to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce  ok dare ma man  pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240684,there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time  as f  scott fitzgerald  gregory peck  and sheilah graham  deborah kerr  are lounging on the beach  suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry  at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past  this  dramatic scene  becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldn t help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was   as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo  no one experiences moments like this  no one  now how much of the rest of the film is true  i cannot say  but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an  8 rolex  and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct  the film is a lot of bunk  however  i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn t seem to clear this up  either   br    br   just who were f  scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like  what i do know about fitzgerald  however  does seem different from what i saw in the film  was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film  well  considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish  i d assume he wasn t  was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film  perhaps  but if he was this bad and yet ms  graham stayed with him  then this makes her out to be a complete dummy  and not someone you d like to see featured in a film  and  if he wasn t  then the film does a poor disservice to his memory  either way  it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience  br    br   the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people  in a dark and salacious way  some might find this all very entertaining  but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way  unpleasant but with glossy production values  especially the music  which was lovely but way over the top  it begs the question  why did they even choose to make this in the first place    the bottom line  it s a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time  even if  like me  you are big gregory peck fan 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295733,i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say it s one of the worst films i ve ever seen  the acting is fair  but the plot is totally ridiculous  a killer is born because of all the  energy used to make the movie  and if the film is burned the killer will die  how unbelievable is that  the characters were underdeveloped to say the least   for example  all of a sudden the man mentions  aren t you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn t   so we re supposed to go along with this  we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film  the movie really didn t spotlight on anyone  we didn t know anything about the main people who survived except ringwald s character was a whiney actress  the guy was on the set when the people died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother  not truly diving in to know who they are  seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings  the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed  anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap  obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making  i can t believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture  it s not funny  it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film  i found myself predicting what would happen before each scene  which believe you me wasn t hard at all to do  it s a disgrace and i m deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess  1 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454349,i have seen a lot of movies   this is the first one i ever walked out of the theater on  don t even bother renting it  this is about as boring a soap opera as one can see   at least you don t have to pay to watch a soap opera  though 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433360,there was some truth to this movie  i remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished  i also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse  or some such charge   i m not sure if it was in australia  the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders  wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception  the film itself reminded me of a simple plan  but as far a being one of the best australian films ever  as someone claimed  i can t be that generous  put it this way  i wouldn t bother watching it again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790781,i would of given this film a zero out of ten  but i will give it a two  reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film  which is not really a reason  last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal  i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress  which is why i didn t enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal  but its no big deal  anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable  lets actually talk about this film  is it good or bad  i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn  me being a fantastic critic  you can see my other 250  review s by clicking on my name  i have great taste  the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema  why is there no morale in this movie  its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks  watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick  man cant kiss properly anyway 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090585,what a great actor to have in such an awful story    br    br   the film and its production  however  is quite good  even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol  no matter   see one cathedral  you ve seen  em all  sort of  br    br   the story however   is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything  should he so wish  with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis  the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy  a teenager and finally as a man  so much so  in fact  that he exacts vengeance at will  literally  over time  he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot   just by thinking about it  br    br   the trouble with the narrative  however  is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi religious claptrap to produce a hodge podge theory about it all  mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works   and i m afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing  his very best scene  however  is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home  sharp  witty and deadly dialog  delivered as only burton could  br    br   a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better  though  beginning with lino ventura  whom i last saw in garde a vu  1981   as inspector brunel  harry andrews as assistant commissioner  the much under rated lee remick as dr zonfeld  derek jacobi as a publisher  towney  and a few other well known character actors  br    br   i liked the way the story was presented  as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar  richard burton   the writer with the killer disposition  up till that point  it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick  still  it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer  br    br   then  they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes  if you want a clue about what that is  think samson and delilah  1949   from the illustrious cecil b  de mille  and how samson got the bad guys in the end  and  the very last scene is just plain stupid  why  because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar s rampaging could have been stopped  absolutely  br    br   shame  actually  because this could have been a lot better story and movie  i guess burton really needed the money  br    br   if you re burton fan  then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above  otherwise  don t bother 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104549,this was a waste of 75 minutes of my life  the acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous  it revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her  and then blackmails them for money  one of the victims is a candidate for da  which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife  another is a plastic surgeon  also married  and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too  meanwhile  the evil lesbian s girlfriend doesn t really like her sleeping around  it ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven  the women get naked a lot too  mostly in situations that stretch reality  bad bad bad 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318040,yeah  i  get  pasolini and his milieu  but at the same time  i feel his  decameron  is largely overrated  and more than a little disturbing  overrated because the supposed  realism  he introduces  milling crowds  crumbling architecture  etc   are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave  in the pursuit of realism  pasolini utilized many non actors  but their deer in the headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off kilter and inconsistent feel  and frankly    many of the toothless  misshapenly featured people are painful to look at  br    br   and pasolini s  decameron  is disturbing  to me at least  because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content  not because i m prudish or homophobic  i m neither  but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo realism he otherwise espouses  so it comes off as gratuitous and forced  one can almost hear him say  ooh  i ve got to stick a cute  naked boy in this scene   at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics  and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself  regardless of what his audience might prefer  br    br   the disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in pasolini s  decameron  struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller  rather than being an aspect of neo realism  he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction  even the pasolini s final line of dialog in the film  which some people seem to find pithy   why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter       to me  it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way  in my opinion  a far better crafted film  and with more homosexual content  is fellini s  satyricon   it is also full of bizarre looking people and absurd situations  but it succeeds because of its pacing  direction and strong storytelling whereas  decameron  fails by those same elements 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375785,okay  i was bored and decided to see this movie  but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage  then basically that same hour repeated 4 times  it consists of 1  gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan  2  flashbacks to the men s wives 3  the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4  men running up hill and shooting  usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him  5  defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6  men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs  that was the basic movie  and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times  and every time it did a flashback to the wives  it would show the man  then his wife and him  there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time  other than that  the men couldn t kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades  i liked the music and there was a lot of action  though the action was repetitive  overall  i probably wouldn t see it again  but it wasn t too horrible 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093223,first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting  some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one  well deserved  star  but then i know that those facts are used for the actor s  names to increase the rating of something like this    br    br   i do have a problem with such productions  yet another attempt  just like  untraceable   of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights  how interesting that it comes at a moment when ips providers trying to  preferentiate    censor information  and the americans and canadians are fighting against that at this very moments   this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil   that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net   but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole  seems like fear promotion is hollywood s norm this days  especially when coming to thrillers which is the most  on demand  motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so   most viewed  best way to try influence the society as a whole  such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and  ethical  people  that it gives a new much needed meaning to  anti heroes  figures  make no mistake   this is not  dexter  which was meant to be high quality entertainment stop selling  fear  please  the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it  br    br   the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration  the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist for sure a  cliche  at least    in real life someone would probably get a beating for it  you will see what i mean   the second scene   with claire danes s character present  is even more extreme  at that point i realized  in my opinion that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him how many people  that have seen or will see this movie  have never been  hold down  regarding both sexes  out of self  common gratification   typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case that unfortunately did  is and will likely happen again sometime   somewhere  but fingers everyone else indirectly as well as  you could become that   etc  anyone that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone  asses    by such fanatical  hero  here  safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with   on his way for some sexual  crusade   have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys   or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on  pg 13  but he can not even see a woman breast until  r 18       yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversions like  american pie  series for example  raise the kids tester one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to unhealthy extremes   all sexual activities upon mutual acceptance  integrates individuals better then some  rightous  nut case  that blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on  the lives of others   a new german movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject  here  like in that movie  you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been  br    br   i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent   hunting party   a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic  hero   after real facts as well  but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone s political and social agenda   the flock  and  untraceable  2 heads of the same hidden beast   it just reminds you  if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole  as erroll babbage has those here  to stay clear of them for their own safety they would kill my family faster then any 0 00001 chances of paul jerrod in anyone s life would    br    br   in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my  assesment  of this particular movie   and  untraceable  actually   so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did  nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the  foot      for once i agree with the rating  this is not a feature for teenagers or kids  simply because at best would confuse them even more then the  common  belief of  money fame fashion  and how that relates to sexuality   scream  series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment value even if a dumb one in my opinion   but this one is just another  trust me i know what is good for you  deeply  not so well done i might add  subliminal messages 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389957,final score  0  out of 10  br    br      possible scene specific spoilers  but who the hell cares     br    br   yes  that s right  zero  and i rarely give 1 s  even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music  cinematography  imagination  it s humor  even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible  looking at it within it s own genera or subgenera  but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here  i can t remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over  the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn t seem to change the channel   i sat there simply aghast  watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next  it was like watching a snake digest a rat   br    br   but let s have some fun and pull this baby apart  shall we  first of all  there is nothing technical about  whipped  that works  the visuals are all sitcom style  the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over  the music and score  not only doesn t contribute anything to the movie   it s obnoxious  not to mention it doesn t have anything to contribute to anyway  the acting is as cardboard as it comes  all around and that goes for amanda peet  clearly the  star  that got this train wreck green lighted  too  these guys  supposedly good friends  have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m  cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting  br    br   on the creative side  there isn t an original bone in it s body  it has no imagination  it shows us nothing we haven t seen a thousand times before  the whole premise  or  twist   of this movie is based on male bashing and the  idea  that an empowered women can play men  just as they get played   anybody  that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before  twisted  shallow women are common  male bashing is the norm  it s not stealing from anything specifically  it s worse  it s stealing from clich s  i can t imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt  makes me want to go rent  in the company of men    or better yet   there s something about mary   this movie wants to be a  edgier  version of  there s something about mary  so bad you can see the sweat   br    br   the movie has no insights into women  men  dating  sex  or really anything  cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies  on the other end  the movie doesn t work as a satire either  because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as  satirical  it doesn t have that grounding in reality that satires need  it doesn t even know what it s satirizing  then there s the dialogue  which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other  example  character 1   f  k you  character 2   oh yeah  well f  k you   repeat  br    br   and the bottom line  the thing that could excuse all the other discretions  there are a lot of movies without plots  without good acting  with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus  been good   whipped  ain t funny  not for a second  it has no comic skills or timing  the situations are all completely phony  not based in any shred of truth  especially enough to wring laughs out of us  the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator  just look at  the marquee scene    cult classic  hair gel scene  one of our bumbling anti heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena  peet  s vibrator  for some reason light shines down on it as if he s found the holy grail  why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know  while he rubs it on himself  he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when  oh my  mena walks in on him  oh  my sides   br    br   but strangely enough  people actually like this movie  of course  people also like  friends  and reality dating shows so i shouldn t be surprised  all of this has a common thread however   whipped  is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex  they will like any show or movie  or think they like it  just because it is about dating or relationships  it s lack of any quality has no baring on these people  just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs  they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating relationship related to sell them cheap  empty  effortless tv  movies and any number of products   br    br   the only consilation will be that when i die  because i saw this movie  i ve got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back   br    br

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184463,although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies  i find this movie to be particularly grating  maybe because i m from a different era and a different country  but i found crosby s continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first  trite after a while and then finally annoying  don t get me wrong   i m not anti american whatsoever   but it seemed that the english could do no right and or needed this brave  oh so smart american visitor to show them the way  it s a  fish out of water  story  but unlike most movies of this sort  this time it s the  fish  who has the upper hand  to be fair to both myself and the movie  i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time  br    br    i watched another crosby movie last night   the emperor s waltz   and that  too  produced the same reaction in me  and to my surprise even my wife   who for what s it s worth is american   found the  in your face  attitude of american crosby to be irritating  one too many references to teddy roosevelt  as she put it    br    br   as for the premise of the movie  it s unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good  the scenery and the music is also good  as are the great costumes   although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid  picture moe of the three stooges   br    br   all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it s pretty hard to sit through this movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083847,i went to see this film with fairly low expectations  figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff  sadly  it wasn t even that  i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out  i went with my two kids  ages 10 and 13  and even they kept asking   how much longer   after lasting until the end  i just kept wondering who would approve this script  even the reliable fred willard couldn t save the trite dialogue  the state jokes  and the banal plot  i d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie  i use the term loosely  should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class  at the least  there are many books on directing  screen writing  and producing movies that would teach them something about structure  plot  dialogue and pacing 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365600,i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo   michelangleo  raphel and donatello so venus here doesn t have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action  we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097714,for romantic comedies  i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience  unfortunately for  the wedding date   i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears  br    br   my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney  but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters  the premise of the film is a reverse  pretty woman   with dermot playing the role of nick  a high priced male escort hired by debra s character kat to accompany her to england for her sister s wedding  a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client  but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial  and there weren t enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat  br    br   in a supporting role  amy adams was a standout as kat s sister  whenever amy came on screen  she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film s energy  perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat  the film might have had more dynamism  but as it turned out  instead of reaching for kleenex  i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066390,i m a fan of matthew modine  but this film  which i stumbled upon on cable  is absolutely witless  i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same  so there was no one around to check her worst instincts  there are no surprises  no original lines  and no original characters  the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character  what a waste of all this acting talent  given how expensive it is to film in new york these days  i have to wonder how this got made in the first place  and if you re wondering why i watched it at all  it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer  it s not a very demanding picture

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105347,just because an event really happened doesn t mean that it will make a good screenplay  movie  the cat s meow  by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst  the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit  the key moments of the story seem implausible  for example  when hurst accidentally shoots the producer  believing him to be chaplin  basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived  the story attempts to be a dark comedy  but the cat s meow misses an important piece of this equation  comedy  there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters  it hardly matters who is shot  who is killed  who is guilty and who is innocent  there is not a strong character to cheer for  as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075781,one of the most common entries in the  goofs  category is anachronism  though i m beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable  even ignored  in very good films  but are found front and center in rotten films  kiss them for me is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism  yet when watching it closely  i found almost nothing specifically anachronistic  br    br   the shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place  the big 4 engine transport seen after the title  honolulu 1944  appears to be the post war c 97 stratofreighter  in mats colors   the combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are douglas skyraiders which entered service after ww2 and were made famous by their service in vietnam  br    br   but excepting these two pieces of film and  of course  the hairstyles  everything else is very possibly period authentic  it just  feels  so wrong  i m an admirer of stanley donen  we share the same birthday  in his co directed on the town  1949  there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949 50 ford s yet there isn t the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a ww2 period film  in fact  as i reflected later  there isn t anything which says that this is supposed to be a ww2 period film  it just feels that way  based on a wartime broadway musical which was based on a ballet  fancy free  which may have been based on the work of artist paul cadmus  the fleet s in  1934  its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in new york and  so heavy with wartime associations  its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell  br    br   the first problem is old cary grant  though far too old to represent a navy sbd dive bomber pilot  it is a hollywood tradition for stars like grant  gary cooper  lou gehrig   jimmy stewart  charles lindbergh  to play younger  it was the role which he is miscast in  not his age  he plays an operator  as they used to call them  a guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it  a hustler  a wheeler dealer  a de rigueur character in a service comedy  grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style  br    br   thinking back on the great grant comic performances like bringing up baby  1938  or arsenic and old lace  1944  and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly  in kiss them he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isn t him  people had already been exposed to the type  most recently to comic phil silvers as sgt  bilko on television  the role would be perfected later by james garner but here grant just isn t funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his cary grantness rather than cajoling and finessing  br    br   but the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women  there can be no more echt 50s women than suzy parker and jayne mansfield  they are unique to the decade  marilyn monroe can be placed in a continuum with carole lombard and marie wilson and any number of dumb blonds  and grace kelly was another high class dame  think of mary astor   but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like mansfield  sure there were the  sweater girls   e g  lana turner  of ww2  but mansfield was stretching the point  suzy parker was the model who revolutionized the model business  who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera  see funny face  1957  also by stanley donen   br    br   of course in high 50s style  there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at  wild  parties but never even a hint of sex  think of the 50s tv shows bachelor father or the bob cummings show where dinner jacketed men returned from  dates  alone   the original book  which i haven t read  was published during the war and appeared as a play on broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences  but broken down  bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast  it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the vcr and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey  br    br   so the lesson here is whatever the  goof  it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane  who actually hears charles foster kane say  rosebud     and tolerated in fun dreck like westworld   why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place   but absolutely despised in a rotten film  even if the goofs are really non existent

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460838,even though the book wasn t strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan  i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn t feel japanese in the slightest  almost everything about it was terrible  i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn t stand a chance of saving it  before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan  30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed  i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it  the whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend  everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces   br    br   to the makers of this movie  you owe me two hours

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347416,i can sum this movie up using 20 words or less  way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face  see  19 words  however  i didn t completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m80  my advice  take the  4 00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck  or you may want to send me the  50 00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865957,awful  just awful  my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy  the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this  they changed so much it is hardly recognisable  which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway  providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment  it s like one of those lifetime movies that say  based on a true story  but are completely fictional  there is none of the emotion or depth of the book  just mindless melodrama  if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading  i suggest you try another version

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089243,is this film a joke  is it a comedy  surely it isn t a serious thriller  there is no suggestion that there is any intended humor  but on quite a few occasions the poor acting  poor directing  and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema  the plot is acceptable   a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake  the killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work  at the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love  it is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted  the film takes place mainly in and around vienna  austria  and shows what a beautiful city it is  do not waste your time on this film though  unless you are studying how not to act  direct or script a film

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217331,the film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened  the crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around  you can fill in the rest  br    br   this is a paycheck picture all around  there seems to be no passion in anyone s performances  nor in anyone behind the camera  this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else  on some level this should have worked  it could have been a more horrific southern comfort  where national guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps   but instead its not much of anything  in large part you can blame the script  written unbelievably in part by wes craven  which hits the same old targets again and again  add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene  br    br   its not bad as such  but badly made and dull  let me put my feelings into context  the reason i saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the last mimzy and i wanted to see what caused the out cry i mean the films have so much in common he says sarcastically   i m convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last mimzy 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094038,from the beginning of the movie  it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something  what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made  he has gone in the opposite way  he had a type of move that he wanted to make  and wrote a story to suite it  and he has failed in it very badly  i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie  any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort  in the credit of the director  he knows the media that he is working with  what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this  here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie  and the actors also have given a decent performance

episodes with razor sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children s programming  much less a movie  which made the original series so well received by adults  i mean  the tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco  and  there were characters who did get killed  although most

to be a distinguished member of british society  hence the preference for england s finest make of motorcars in the original series  one other reviewer here indicated that penelope wouldn t be caught dead in a ford  he s pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn t work  at least they could have had penelope ride in a jaguar made up like fab 1 since jaguar is a british car make that is owned by ford  but no  they had to use a straight ford  but the ford product placement doesn t end there  every single car you may see is a ford  even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were sponsored by ford  ford  ford  ford  the predominance of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford   br    br   the original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today  but  the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional  this kind of treatment didn t exist in the movie  where everything is stylized to excess  defeating the sense of functionality and practicality  a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style  many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason  br    br   the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets  bringing them to life in the episodes  the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story  the characters  and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective  a little bit of stanislavski talk   the movie  on the other hand  had some overly grating performances  anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault  bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn t work despite decent acting  one of few   there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley  and many others that i don t care to mention  it would take too long   quite simply  the puppets were more believable  second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by hans zimmer  sounding more like a mix between  days of thunder  and  apollo 13    br    br   and  of course  the hood  the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with kyrano through a statue of kyrano as an outlet for esp contact  but  that was where his extraordinary capability ended  he s a master of disguise and deception  which allows him to sneak around undetected  for the most part  anyways  to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means  he also uses weapons for his own defense  including pistols  and generally collects information using a film camera  although he tried to steal thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s united artists release of  thunderbird 6   which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in supermarionation and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release   but  while he is a nemesis of international rescue  the hood isn t the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue  in the movie  he s obviously the main villain  but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons  along with the hood having extended mind control ability  including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time  this totally deviates from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust  br    br   there are more criticisms  but the 1000 word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them  so  i will close with the point being made that i didn t enjoy this movie  as a matter of fact  i think it sucks  having seen the original series and supermarionation movies  thunderbirds are go  thunderbird 6   i was hoping for something a lot better than this  br    br   the original supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce   and that s saying it nicely     kip wells
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427038,during a sleepless night  i was switching through the channels   found this embarrassment of a movie  what were they thinking  br    br   if this is life after  remote control  for kari  wuhrer  salin  no wonder she s gone nowhere  br    br   and why did david keith take this role  it s pathetic  br    br   anyway  i turned on the movie near the end  so i didn t get much of the plot  but this must ve been the best part  this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix ish girl   this scene is straight out of the comic books    or the cheap porn movies  she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father  oh  i didn t expect tongue   great lines  br    br   after this  i had to see how it ended   br    br   well  of course  this bitch from hell has a helluva past  so the swat team is upstairs  and yes   they surround her  and yes yes  the kid blows her brains out     ahahhahahaha   br    br   this is must see tv   br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410162,if you like to be entertained  do not go see this movie  if you like to see heroics of war  do not go see this movie  if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay  do not go see this movie  if you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war  go see this movie  otherwise  don t waste your time  i am always interested in war movies because i think that if they are done well  they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war  this film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside  saying whorrible cliche lines  doing the most predictable things  and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed  this film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the united states of america  can you imagine being a person from europe or africa  or any other country and watching this  being told that this is how americans truly are  no wonder everyone hates us  please  please  please  don t waste your time on this piece of junk  if you must  wait and rent it  4 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200071,although misty ayers  burlesque stripper  is certainly attractive as the blonde lead  this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times  no nudity in 1954 when this film was made  not 1965   br    br   the guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott   costello  most of the other woman are unattractive  and the drunken woman is semi amusing in a creepy way  br    br   a 2 out of 10  ms  ayers has a curvacious physique  but you can t judge any acting talent because the entire film is post dubbed  some of these  exploitation films   usually made later than this one  are interesting in some way  but this is really a bore fest  sid melton  make room for daddy  directed  there are some samurai like facial expressions and interesting apartments  but there s really nothing here

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250739,i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that  the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn t expect a fundamentalist christian film  br    br   the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being  our hero  who is a bible professor from the 1890s  eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil   jesus is nowhere to be found  this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg wells style time machine  the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point  which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film  earlier  or perhaps immediately later  can t remember for certain   our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says  what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about  however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful  br    br   in any case  that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time  so  if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors  then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn t a very strong believer as i don t think there s any evidence  and none was offered  for the physics of time travel in the bible  so immediately there s a problem with mixed messages and credibility there  but never mind    br    br   after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future  the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases  it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year  as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself  a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date  it s just two thousand and     honk    some of the shock went on a little too long  though  for instance  the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he s invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van  he sticks his head out the window like a dog might  is scared by the headlights and the starting engine  etc  that seemed a bit off since he d been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic  in any case  that s easy to ignore  the rest of the tech shock was well done   especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn t even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote  br    br   unfortunately  our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he s an authority on all life and religion just because he s from the past and is an elder  eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful  but mostly was just more of the same  a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy  go figure  and investigate his name  they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is  the movie frames these guys as non believer bad guys for being skeptical  br    br   just before the professor is to head back to his own time  he is confronted by those two men  in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away  he eventually breaks into an almost insane like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he s a prophet so they should listen to him  just in time  he s whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he d heard so much about  br    br   the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self proclaimed  and most likely false  prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god given knowledge  that was stated or even hinted at   br    br   as i understand it  revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying  and failing  to send a bible into the future  first 2080  then 2070  etc  as the scene fades out  clearly he s trying to determine the exact date of the end times   which he shouldn t be able to know  essentially  the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only  it means there couldn t ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know  the entire movie s premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it s own credibility in the end 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071415,i basically found eden s curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch  however  there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70 s in the choice of settings and clothing  the  back to the earth  philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent  as portrayed in many later versions of the 70 s was right on  as was the  don t ask don t tell  pseudo liberalism of the fraternity made up of east coast intellectuals  except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia  where i imagine the  good ole boy  mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one  another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images  i felt it was very unfortunate that  gay culture  took on certain standard forms in the 80 s out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles  i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without  the scene  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082799,this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story  not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations  if the great m r  james had ever come up with a tale this thin    doesn t james in fact have a story called  a thin ghost      he wouldn t have bothered to have it published  br    br   orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends  this film s producers  his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o  the wisp its oscar nomination  this is yet more proof  if any more were needed  that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087056,as gently as i can  i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time  i did not find it the  warm  emotionally satisfying  film others did  i found it boring  with music that distracted from the film  the story was thin  the characters overdrawn  and the direction pedestrian  br    br   fooey  br    br   now i m going to write some more about this movie  so i make the 10 line minimum  there really isn t more to be said and brevity is important  but imdb has its minimums  so here goes  br    br   young eager kid finds nascent talent  seeks time with aging  embittered mentor in spite of father s cartoonish homophobia  aging  embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little  conflict arises  while i don t think this is a spoiler  i ve added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much   br    br   mostly  i just found the film boring and pretentious  a waste of my time  i honestly don t understand what little fuss there seems to be  mostly on this web site  about the transcendent quality of this movie  i think it s really worth avoiding  but  as dennis miller used to say   maybe i m wrong

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000,i just finished watching this movie  i was very excited since i m a big fan of punk rock  horror films and spoofs  i was very surprised at what i saw  i knew it was low budget  but i wasn t expecting it to be taped with a video camera  it opens with a good song and a great  very underrated band  the horrorpops  reforming their song  where they wander  and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways  it s a great opening  but the problem is the fact that  up until the end  this was really all that the movie was  a live performance  a death  another live performance  a death  it gets old  and there is a gross literally  overuse of intestines in the death scenes  why doesn t the killer use other body parts  like legs  or eyeballs  or brains  don t get me wrong  this movie has some parts that are awesome  like the hardcore french band  known simply as beret  the prospect of a band named atticus  the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together  since neither bands had enough members to play their show  and bowling for soup s overweight and proud of it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner  that i will save for the future watchers of this movie  but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical  but after a while  terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the  actors   especially warped tour creator  kevin lyman  he tries very hard  but i suspect that he didn t want to make the film  but was contractually obligated or something  in addition to that  the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd  the movie s resolving plot is very hazy and very random  something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil  bottom line  this movie has a lot of good qualities  but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror  music  or comedy film  although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to  otherwise  such as tsunami bomb  and the phenomonauts an insane  psychobilly band   i recommend that you rent this movie  watch the first 10 or 20 minutes  if you like it  watch the next 20 or 30  if you still like it  then watch on  if not  just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances  they rock  long live punk rock and horror

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081242,for the first couple of seasons  i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show  the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job interview was innovative  and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too  out there   br    br   the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business   at all  in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business related tasks   now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show  that means lying  trash talking  backstabbing etc    the boardroom can be entertaining to watch  but it s entertainment at it s low point   sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode  the tasks on the show are  at most  boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity  and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6  that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life   br    br   i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season  they all seem like idiots to me  in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity  now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show  it also seems like donald trump s massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest  i can t see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him  his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn t make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it s worth  br    br   r i p the apprentice  please nbc  for god s sake  get the show off the air as soon as possible  it s just too embarrassing to watch  the apprentice was once a great tv show  but now it s just a big fat joke

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089880,much has been made of rohmer s use of digital technology to  fill in  the background  at times it works well  the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king s execution is particularly striking  at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look  resembling a home video  however  the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer  we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters  to be frank  i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke  br    br   the other major failing  i regret to say  is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role  she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance  ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion  her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler  an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel  seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience  also  watch her hands when she is expressing emotion  br    br   all in all a very disappointing film  particularly given the positive reviews on this site

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068966,i really love the sexy action and sci fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress s that appeared in them  they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn t matter if they could act  remember  candy     the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn t nostalgic enough  the story here has a european sci fi film called  dragonfly  being made and the director is fired  so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker  jeremy davies  to complete the picture  they re is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she s barely in it  film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script  i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films  they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them  there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law  barbarella   gerard depardieu  giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well  i guess i m going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties  if any are reading this   make it as sexy as you can   i ll be waiting

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065750,this film really got off to a great start  it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending  romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between  harlan  and tobe in long  poetic and idyllic scenes  it really didn t need to be anything more than that  and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake  another timeless classic  a modern myth perhaps  why  oh why  then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character  norton another psycho  maybe i m missing the point  but do we really need another film about psychos  or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry  for a moment there  i was going to make a mental note of the director s name  now i m left feeling indifferent  at least it should be added in the film s defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles  also  evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150786,and it doesn t help rohmer s case that a few years later syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject  with a little help from wagner   br    br   maybe this movie didn t look so paltry when it came out  without the syberberg film to compare it to  which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources  i actually can t recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film  all i know is  the german version is pure magic  while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes  br    br   the music    la musique    isn t even credited here on imdb    but someone based it on  airs from the 12th 14th centuries  or something    well it isn t a great help to the film  it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy  comme le frommage mon cher    br    br   rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive  too  and that doesn t help matters  syberberg s parsifal was adorable  and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented       br    br   i shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like  i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater  the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty  but even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer  i m afraid  br    br   points for earnestness  for chutzpah  but    this film simply needed beau coup more bucks  it doesn t look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheapo  bon marche   oh and yeah  it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected    blah 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089034,one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story  one loved it or hated it  but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10  for me  this movie rated a 4  there are some beautiful scenes and locations  and ray milland turns in a fabulous job as oliver s father  but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story  and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings  at least  not for me  i may be a bit of a snob  but i tend to avoid movies with ryan o neal    i still haven t seen barry lyndon    because most of them  but not all  are ruined for me by his presence  the lone exception is what s up  doc   in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for barbra streisand s goofball protagonist    and  not coincidentally  he takes a shot at love story for good measure  mcgraw and o neal tend to mug their lines  rather than act them  br    br   this movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career  it was tommy lee jones s first movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430768,after some internet surfing  i found the  homefront  series on dvd at ioffer com  before anyone gets excited  the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago  the resolution and quality are poor  the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look  although the commercials were edited out  the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program  nightline   complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 s  even with the poor image quality  the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine  br    br   to this show s credit  the casting was nearly perfect  everyone was believable and really looked the part  their acting was also above average  the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler  most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong   the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets  especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d cor  the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time  for example  conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes  the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations  that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case  br    br   as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago  despite all the ingredients for a fine show  the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start  for one thing  the name of the show itself is totally misleading  when wwii ended in 1945  there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a  homefront  either  curiously  the first episode of the show  homefront  begins in 1945 after the war had ended  that s like shooting the first episode of  gilligan s island  showing the castaways being rescued  the whole premise of the show s namesake is completely lost  i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no  the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948  additionally  this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 s  by the third episode  it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda  the show is set in river run ohio  near toledo  however  the show s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio  part of the ensemble cast are dick williams  hattie winston and sterling macer jr  who portray the davis family  much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil  whites  to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable  the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years  we get it  we re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis  the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show  as it was for  homefront   the acting talents of williams  winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical  frightened   angry black family   the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something  the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing  and leave it at that  devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid  br    br   in yet another ridiculous plot line  the big boss of a local factory  ken jenkins  is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees  the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer  br    br   personally  i think this series had great potential  the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941   1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories  of course the loss of brothers  sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama  the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific  the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless  but no  the writers of homefront  david assael and james grissom  completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots  instead  they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics  it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089308,in 1993   the visitors  was an enormous hit in france  so  the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately  this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made   br    br   this is a movie that doesn t keep its promises  indeed  it s supposed to tell a sole story  jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course  the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century  and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard    instead of this  the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot  as a consequence  the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed  sometimes a bit of a mess  br    br   but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors  reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie  they re going over the top and become annoying  then  why did jean marie poir  the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role  he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful  the other actors aren t better  marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau  unbearable  br    br    of course  the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness  certain sequences and dialogs are affected  it also appears hollow because poir  takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie  thus  a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding  br    br   a labored and disappointing follow up  anyway  what s the interest of this movie otherwise commercial  br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071627,for your own good  it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie  this flick stinks  now  i like  at least in theory  low budget horror movies  but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make  it takes itself way too seriously  and  unfortunately  that s not it s only problem  br    br   it s the story of the murderous beane clan of the british ilses transposed to modern times  an interesting premise  but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it  br    br    1  why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson  she s a below average looking woman who can t act  and she has a minor role  answer  she s apparently a well known porn star  as you no doubt read in other reviews   so i guess this is a  cameo  appearance for her  she s giving the film much needed  name recognition   it seems  her top billing isn t any indication of her talent  though  it s an indication of how untalented the rest of the cast is  br    br    2  how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland  it doesn t even remotely look like ireland  and the house that the guests victims stay in is this great big north american wood frame edwardian thing  they should have skipped the whole beane theme and developed a story that took place in n a  also  if you re going to make a movie that takes place in ireland  it s probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent  and that was a really really really bad irish accent   now this wouldn t have been so bad if the director wasn t trying to make the next  night of the living dead   but it seems he was  too bad  he could have had some fun with it  in fact  some of the scenes weren t far from being unintentionally comedic as they were  br    br   like the infamous gutting scene  were the woman is chained to the table  stripped naked  and then sliced open and eviscerated  that s funny  you ask  well  in the deleted scene version  the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines  it s actually funny after awhile  and what self respecting cannibal eats intestines  anyway  do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens  heck no  we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks  oh well  br    br   some of the other cast who were annoying  the whiny  creepy howard rosenstein  i m not sure  but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud  in fact  he s as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply  which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for him  br    br   i checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb  and apparently it s important to know that she graduated high school with honors  i can t decide if it s more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation  the honor student is doing nude soft core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard rosenstein  wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie  if they have  hopefully they ll get the message  avoid this fate  go to college    i could go on and on  but why  if you like gore  you ll find something redeeming in this flick  but not much more 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090799,be warned  this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence  br    br   the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways  br    br   each story has only a few minutes  so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot  just an sketchy idea of a plot  the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer  however  that just didn t work out because you didn t get to know the characters in before or these  jokes  were just silly  br    br   this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart  a dozen times  or even more  i don t know and i don t care 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110823,predictable  hackneyed   poorly written  foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit  i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days  and will only get worse  that one cannot pick and choose much any more  early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since  the movie lacked intrigue  giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder  some of the discourse was  frankly  embarrassing  it s hard to believe anyone would even consider  let alone commit to  the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446685,this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen  the first being ghost rider   there is absolutely no plot  climax  conflict  or any other major detail required in portraying a story  this  film  is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his manly side and  the  tough guy he really is   i completely wasted my time watching this film  the best part would have to be the ending credits  if i were ebert or roper  i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers  whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film  is obviously on the same mental level as him  in conclusion  do not waste your time watching this movie  it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110613,   you know the rest  if you want a good zombie movie  don t rent this movie  if you want a documentary esquire look at  hood life  you re at the wrong place as well  if you re looking for a laughable piece of film  this is a real winner  the acting is as flat as a piece of paper  the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive by  i can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice  if i could hear a cardboard box talk  it d probably sound like this guy  oh yea  and the  zombies  did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall  note sarcasm   how did this not win an oscar for best make up  the quiroz      did not do any sort of directing  i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece  the period is more like 1990 s la  the direction is however one uped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie  i haven t heard such lovely lines  like the epic one word beginning to the movie  f  k    since ice grill which was another  urban  thriller  this only works of course in conjunction with the also epic hip hop soundtrack  all 3 or so songs of it  all in all  what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled  hood of the living dead   i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene  and boy it delivered and more  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror  yea right     movie for the night  a memorable experience for sure

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016392,while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing  i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery  perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age  the movie was made  as it is now 2002  an official five years ago   after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings  and science fiction feats like star wars  as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer s the odyssey  br    br   my beef  basically  is that i couldn t relate   i am just about the same age of the children  a young adult   and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available  but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence  i didn t find myself saying  ack  i would have done the same thing    it did not open the doors to my imagination  even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies  standing alone  certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche  the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking  seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run  even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement  a typical set of one or the other stereotypes  there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious  accompanied by mr  perfect image of combining athletics  good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude  and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days  while i know the personalities pushed the story along  i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable   and believable  as far as character    movie  br    br   i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design   that made it worth finishing to the end for me  don t get me wrong  all movies are worth seeing for yourself  and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many  but i think that with a little more depth to the script  and a little more  i cannot believe i am saying this  realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088760,though the title includes the word  zombies   this film is not what you d expect from a movie made today  though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected  dean jagger portrays armand louque  an officer in the french army of world war i  who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons  or  zombies   who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war  though on whose side is not certain  at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon  but eventually french general duval  george cleveland  orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it  br    br   the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque  duval s daughter claire  dorothy stone   and clifford grayson  robert noland   all a part of the expedition  when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve  grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power  that advice begins to transform louque  particularly after he s successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city  having followed a temple priest into a swamp  louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking  though it s not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of  zombiefication   all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye  and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control  this comes in handy for winning back his girl  and taking grayson s early advice as he comments to his servant   buna  we re learning to be ruthless   br    br   fans of early  b  horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosi s signature eye stare  plucked from the 1932 film  white zombie   also from director victor halperin  of the two movies   white zombie  is preferably superior  both in story content and in it s depiction of the undead  where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening  in  revolt   the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor s commands  in fact  the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire  they overrun his compound and kill him in the process  br    br   not to be too harsh on the film  it plays out decently within the parameters of it s story outline  but if you re thinking  zombies     within the traditional context  you ll probably be disappointed  if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject  the aforementioned  white zombie  with bela lugosi is the way to go 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326746,funny that i find myself forced to review this movie  but here i am  br    br   i am reviewing it  because just recently  i have had the chance to witness the revival of r c  sheriff s play  journey s end  on stage in new york  at the belasco theatre  starring hugh darcy  boyd gaines  jefferson mays and others  as well as being masterfully directed by david grindley  br    br   i left the theater shattered  i am not exaggerating  i was flabbergasted  after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier s life in the trenches of the somme  i speculate   during world war one  brought to life vividly  by everyone involved  i came out of the theater with the shakes  br    br   mind you  i am not easily shocked  nor am i too sensitive  i am a stage actor and a director myself  so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects  both emotionally  as well as psychologically  br    br   but what i had just witnessed  came so much to life  that i had chills in my spine as i left  br    br   none of these emotions came to life  while watching  aces high   the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen  in cooperation with r c  sheriff himself  shortly before he died  br    br   the screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france  so  gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with  br    br   the only plus of the movie  are the aerial battle scenes  which look dated in their special effects  compared to today s standards  but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen  br    br   granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of  all quiet on the western front  by erich maria remarque  which takes place in trenches  and not in the sky  but that was the  german  vision on things  if one would like to be picky on such things  br    br    journey s end  is just the other side of the medal  and would have made it into a great movie  if they had left it alone and intact  br    br   the transfer on dvd is poor  even though in widescreen and adapted for 16 9 tv screens  the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater  nothing more  nothing less  it sports various defects  such as minor scratches and dots  although the copy  for the rest  is clean  br    br   if you want another wwi movie in your collection  especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old timers  then this is a picture for you  but i rather would suggest  von richthofen and brown  as an alternative  although that too  is a movie filled with inaccuracies  br    br   for the rest of you  who love good acting and drama  i would leave this one out  buy the play  go watch the play  if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you  but keep off this would be adaptation  br    br   it is an anti war movie  granted  but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime ever  br    br   the presence of actors such as trevor howard  ray milland  richard johnson and john gielgud  is just a bluff  since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie  br    br   mcdowell  the very talented christopher plummer  simon ward and peter firth  all deliver very weak performances  not due to their lack of skills  but rather due to lack of true and solid direction  br    br   there are too many gaps in it  and as said before  it drags itself to the dubious end  dubious because in the original play  none of the men we come to know and sympathize with  stay alive  they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission  in the movie they all die  except malcolm mcdowell  who manages somehow to stay alive another day  being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch  just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause  br    br   the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness  you just hear the cannons roar  the machine guns rattle  and grenade impacts throughout the theater  then  suddenly  total peace and silence  the curtain comes up  lights  and here they all are  lined up  standing straight and rigid  obedient corpses    br    br   far more interesting and far more shocking than  aces high  finale  which is also dragged by the hair  br    br   it is up to you to judge  br    br   for me  if i had the money and the contacts to do so  i would take the play and develop it  the way it was meant  adding here and there some action scene in the field  just to visualize the  outer  horror and slaughter going on in the  vasty fields of france   around the men involved  but then  just strictly concentrating on what is going on  in that tiny  shack  at the edge of sanity and the world    br    br   want such a movie  br    br   then ask for it  br    br   this is not it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078675,from the critical acclaim  i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins  the story just meandered along and didn t seem to have a point or a plot  and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl  mature for her age or no  would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity  over with   maybe i am too young to relate  i was four years old in 1976   but i didn t have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn t alive for either of those settings  the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience  overall  slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks  i would say skip this one 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096786,from the q   a before and after  this is what i could gather  some irish guy wants to make a movie  nothing in particular  just any movie  so  one night at a party  he hears some ex roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n  roll lore  the one about how gram parsons  corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie so he could honor parsons  wishes that he be cremated out in joshuatree  wow  br    br   what a great idea for a movie  rock n  roll  well  country   grave robbing  escapes  friendship  the 70 s  i guess we could get johnny knoxville from  jackass   cause it s kind of a prank  right  and knoxville wants to do  a movie  too  why he must have thought he had the next  snatch  on his hand  br    br   but this story s not really that exciting   we need something for knoxville to struggle against like a psychotic girlfirend after his money  but parsons  was married at the time  that s o k   no one knows that  besides we could get christina applegate  but what if the audience doesn t like the idea of stealing a corpse well  we ll get his dad to join the chase  but give permission in the end  but parsons  dad killed himself when he was 10  in fact his orphan status  and tragic childhood  are key parts of the parsons mythology  mythology  we re making  a movie   this is creative problem solving  br    br   it s an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject  applegate s presence is doubling jarring  first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time  she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand  and secondly  what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy  facts aren t just distorted or left out  but reversed  they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons stepfather  who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance  br    br   and the music  oh  the music i love  the music is hacked up  the bridge of a song here  the chorus there   forced to the background  and in the end  horribly covered by the hippest new indie band  starsailor  my girlfriend asked the unnecessary  but irresistable question after the movie   was anyone up there  the writer  the producers  the director  actually a gram parson s fan  well  no  he d never actually heard of gram parsons  but of course  blah blah blah  i learned to love it  and here s some factoids i read in a bio online  another guy vouched for parsons  coolness by saying he and keith richards tripped on acid together and wrote  wild horses  together  a mixed up bunch of facts as off base as the movie  another person asked  wasn t it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film  well  he had the real roadie s permission  he was even set  and the parsons estate gave permission  and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great  br    br   but what i really wondered was  and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parsons geek  was  if the movie s so cheaply made  a million   had they not considered the original gram parsons fanbase as an audience  the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase  though i doubt any mojo magazine reading  country rock 70 s music fan would agree  but a bunch of brits made it i guess  and they just didn t care about cosmic american music  or even knew it existed  this isn t just not a truthful parsons flick  it s not even in the right spirit  it doesn t even fit the legend  at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs  and plenty of people would love to be told  br    br   i should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids  just off the slopes  and into johnny knoxville  but if you re a parsons fan ignore the title  it s just a movie for jackass fans 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088959,not too keen on this really  the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing  i enjoyed the first 10 minutes  bill nunns good  after that it was pretty appalling  tim doesn t fit the role  he comes across as a smug self inflated ass   pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player  it s a idealist film and as a musician  feel slightly offended after watching it  there s no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates  he s completely self indulgent  i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character  maybe i m watching the wrong film  if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093894,ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects  jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself  if you remember him  he was from the movie dragon  the bruce lee story    jason london is funny as luke  the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula s body from the slab  diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula s body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend  and stephen billington is great as dracula himself  giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film  roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie  and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee s character  this is the second sequel in the trilogy  and they are off to a good start  it s up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291502,this is complete and absolute garbage  a fine example of what a bad movie is like  this can t be appealing to anyone  not even b movie fans  do not  i repeat  do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash  bad acting  bad directing  horrible  but i mean really horrible  script  and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment  of any form  is  i bought the dvd for 3 dollars  i swear i could almost pay someone to take it  burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me  i like b movies  the killer toys  the weird lagoon monsters  but this is nowhere near  you know those movies that are so bad they are funny  not even  just plain old pathetic 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044876,i sat through this turkey because i hadn t seen it before  and because the premise sounded like it had potential  it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence  at the height of the storm  the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house  yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving  in fact  when the characters move outside the house  bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops  at that point  whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film  too bad all hurricanes aren t like this one  it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818,sure  it had some of the makings of a good film  the storyline is good  if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn t understand why olivia d abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us  my biggest problem  however  was with the wardrobe  i know as rule  the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self respecting european but this was beyond that  anna s colour combinations were positively ghastly   and that potato sack like  sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives  i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible  how many school teachers walk around in prada   but simple doesn t mean an absolute lack of taste  a word to the wise   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112159,i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie  i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions  i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios  therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases  but this movie was just a dud  period  the premise was terrible  the main character  mary gordano  alicia silverstone   was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes  there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world  also  to make this movie more mysterious  the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood  especially in the warehouse  br    br   once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424787,to describe this film as garbage is unfair  at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby  this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining  br    br   kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance  so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay  the mad scientist story of  hollow man  has been told before  been told better  and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects  br    br   most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men  women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies  in the uk they were marketed as  the transparent man   woman dog   which is maybe where they got the title for this film  br    br   clever special effects  dire script  non existent plot  br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447987,the good thing about this that s at least fresh  almost no movies about dance music and the club scene  if even made  hit the cinemas  and it radiates lots of energy too  from the music to the portrayal of ibiza  br    br   but the main problem is that it can t decide what it wants to be  although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap  the makers also realized they wouldn t want to play copycat  however  it fails grossly on the jokes because it s not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped  and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes  so why not edit it down to 75  the production department and cinematography still try to save the day  e g  paul s home   br    br   in a strange way and unexpectedly so it s all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous  especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting power  br    br   conclusion  it s a mess  it somewhat entertains at a basic level  but you better spend a night in your favorite club 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369,david mamet s film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking man s movie  a movie that makes you question everybody and everything  i saw it for the first time recently and couldn t understand what was supposed to be so great about it  br    br   the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best selling author  margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone  she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient s gambling debt to a shark named mike  played by joe mantegna  who is the only reason to watch this film   she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her  intrigued  she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate  she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book   she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up  br    br   i don t feel like going into details  but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of  80 000  br    br   first of all  the big twist towards the end was very predictable  any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads  not only that  but the audience  and the main character  knows that they re dealing with con men  so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned  besides  margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people  yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily    and keep in mind  she knows full well that mike is a con artist  br    br   secondly  we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning  yet in order for the con to ultimately work  she had to do several things that the con men couldn t possibly have predicted that she would do  first  she had to decide to help settle her patient s debt  allowing her to meet the con men in the first place  if she hadn t done this  the entire con would have failed  i just have to say that it s pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient s gambling debt  not only that  but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up  did they simply show up at that bar every night  hoping she would come and see them  another thing that had to happen that couldn t have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade  what are the odds of this happening  and yet the whole con is based on this premise  br    br   another problem i had is with the ending  margaret finds out she s been conned and decides to get revenge on mike  at first  mamet leads us to believe that she s going to con the con  but that falls through  so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area  somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade  not only that  but she didn t even take back the money he stole from her  br    br   ultimately  the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled  and if you  like me  predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned  you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081793,i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language   not  dialect  as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as  as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other   but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie  being a canadian  of cebuano parents  i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film  i was further excited to hear that it wasn t another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies  but alas  i was short changed  br    br   panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano  montano of course plays the hero of the movie  and when i say  hero  i mean in the most stereotypical of manners  his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol anons to victory against the japanese  his character has no depth or complexity  he just fits the hero mold  the rest of the characters are one dimensional  they all fit their cookie cutter roles  br    br   i m all for slow moving meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving  it didn t really meditate on anything  just because a movie is historically themed  a drama and slow moving doesn t make it a well made film  br    br   particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony  his performance was embarrassing  br    br   if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through  he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc  but really  this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals  to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences  even if it meant sacrificing quality  obviously he didn t think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door  br    br   i m afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie  if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i d get an answer like   visayans don t make good movies  didn t you see panaghoy sa suba   of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see  br    br   an example of movies that are meditative  not just slow moving  are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch s the straight story  i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie  these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called  pure cinema   images without words are used to convey the story  but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie  and they do it very well  panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood  br    br   and what s with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120577,the show s echoed  bubbling  sound effect used to put me to sleep  a very soothing show  i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril  i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs  florida  i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there  i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge of the seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother s house    imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads  i thought  flipper  had better undersea action  of course  he had the advantage of being in his natural environment

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053241,this was a complete disappointment  the acting isn t bad  but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it  but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie  it is o k  if you are o k  with cheesy moral plots and don t mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman  if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295289,being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films  some good and some bad  but i would have to say that  summer rain  is by far the worse film i have ever seen  i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as  secrets and lies  or  lockstock  but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script  reminded me of a bad  theatre in education  school production   the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start   michelle  the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and gary was so wet  he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes  that by the end of the film i really didn t give a damn about either of them  all i could think was   i paid  3 for this pile   i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production  so please avoid at all costs  thanks for reading 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318040,the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as  inexplicably  footage from another uli lommel   suzanna love film brainwaves  it is framed with some more current  from the early 90 s anyway  footage that is boring  poorly acted and cheaply shot  not only is the film almost completely flashbacks  they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film  so you see the recycled footage over and over again  as if you hadn t seen it already  as if the originals weren t bad enough  i ve never seen a movie so padded     someone was milking the last dollar out of these films  total ripoff  and talk about padding    why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash  if i can convey that it s garbage in 2 lines  that should be enough 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247804,generally i like horror movies  but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand  we sat down to watch it  ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much  the concept isn t that bad  but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i don t know  the worst thing about the movie is the actors  the camera work was poor  the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous  but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm  they were wooden beyond measure  especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent  he looked more like a public school boy in fact  there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical  but then i remembered it wasn t supposed to be a comedy  i m desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts  but there simply isn t  let s hope ten was the lucky number and they don t do another one  i m not sure my ribs could take it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874917,this isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen  but i really can t recall when i ve seen a worse one  i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation  what it really was is a soap opera  and a bad one at that  they overplayed the  conflict  card to the extreme  the first hour or so seems like a shouting match  with some implausible scenes thrown in  br    br    possible spoiler  br    br   the 40 or so minute  memorial  scene  with requisite black umbrellas and rain  to fictitious crash victims was lame  and i thought it would never end   br    br   avoid this one at all costs  unless you revel in  conflict   br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113313,this movie was 100  boring  i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater  it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either  it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie  god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374089,i can t believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie  i m a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy  and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey   see  for example  my glowing review of altered states  1980    br    br   a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie  the problem is not that the producers had a low budget  it s that they didn t care  br    br   now  to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box  br    br   chicago tribune br    br   san francisco chronicle br    br   san francisco bay guardian br    br    actually  i enjoy reading the latter two  still  their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor  but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera  a cheesy plot and stupid effects  i ll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419815,this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s  jack pearl  radio s  baron munchausen   as well as jimmy durante  however  7 1 2 decades later  it s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today  film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts  br    br   as for the stooges  this is a film from there very early days  before mgm had any idea what to do with the team  at this point  they were known as  ted healy and his stooges  as healy was the front man  fortunately for the stooges  they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man  read up on him  you ll see what i mean  and the rest is history  within a year  they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team  this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm  a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy  such as the films of buster keaton  laurel and hardy  abbott and costello and others   in fact  up until they left for columbia  mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles  including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady  and  oddly  in this film they didn t act as a team  they just did various supporting roles  such as larry playing the piano  br    br   this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle  when they are rescued and brought home  all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show  punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there  as for pearl  i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films  as he has the personality of a slug  but slightly less welcome   as for durante  i never knew what the public saw in him  as least as far as his films are concerned  he was loud and   loud  he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton s career to make this film  together  pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor    and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat  br    br   in this film  the stooges they didn t yet have the right chemistry  seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd  what they did in the film was pretty good  but because all the segments were short  they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines  stooges fans might be very frustrated at this  though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge  even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films  oh  and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly   br    br   overall  the film is rather dull and disappointing  however  there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess  at about the 13 minute mark  you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing  look carefully  as this is walter brennan in a role you d certainly never expect  another unusual thing to look for in the film is the  clean as a whistle  song starting at about 22 minutes into the film  this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called  pre code  scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934  when the production code was strengthened   despite the word  clean  in the title  it s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh  enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything  it s quite shocking when seen today  though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s  finally  at the 63 minute mark  see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades  see the film  you ll see that i mean 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040175,my husband and i went to see this movie  being the horror movie buffs that we are  two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back  i was so disappointed  the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film  there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances  etc  i found most of the  scary  parts to be more comical than anything  after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers  i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us  my advice  if you are a fan of true horror movies  save yourself the pain of sitting through this one  i can t really say that i would recommend renting it either  unless you have a free rental coming to you 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805570,cq was the worst film i saw this year  nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say  this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro  to filmmaking class  his father makes great films  his sister made a good one  but brother roman  no  one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard s le m pris  contempt   while coppola  jr  did take the same idea  a film about film  he tried too hard to make himself seem european  artsy  and witty  when it s all really just kitsch  the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film  like he s either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him  schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director  depardieu is alright  the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is  surprisingly  not the b movie scenes  but rather one which takes place in italy  a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car  driving around picking up and dropping off random people  this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof  or rip off  or both  the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out  the ending was tagged on for the sake of a  twist  or artistic value    i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself  and not in the way it intended  no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re edited or re shot or whatever  which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before  i can t believe it could have been worse than this  if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films  any of them  the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film  lil  romy  for the sake of cinema  please go back to directing your cousin s music videos  leave the godfathers to daddy 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105428,a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one  it needed some dependence on something  br    br   this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people  were they trying to imitate the wonderful film  crash   if so  this film crashed entirely  br    br   there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem  br    br   the film is just too choppy to work  one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor  this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing  the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance  br    br   then  we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank  obviously  the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks  perhaps  the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217331,when i first saw this film  i thought it should have come from the children s section   it s very fun and at times humorous  and is actually quite a good story  but it severely lacks the  romantic chemistry  that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering  i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein  and his performance is extraordinary  but that s the sole exception  this film appears a bit forced  the directing lacks substance  and oh yeah   the music is ridiculously awful  it didn t put me in a very good mood  but if you are not expecting a smart  well crafted comedy romance tale  then this certainly can be entertaining  like i said  it should be in the children s section  einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins  boring  almost tense quest to steal meg ryan s heart  a very conflicting film  but as long as it s not taken seriously this can be an alright movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366043,i was intrigued to see how a little seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see the hurt locker  sadly  all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off the screen reasons  br    br   the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see  when it s not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire  annoying  shaky cam  visuals  it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing  br    br   the  plot  is threadbare  the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected beetle bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue   on the instances where the film gives up on being  minimalist  and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes   is some of the worst ever recorded  in fairness  the actors do the best they can in the circumstances  just not enough to obscure how bad the project is  br    br   the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of  mockumentary  that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama  br    br   if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back  and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109595,i cannot stand this show  has there ever been even one redeeming quality  one funny punchline  or one plot line that  didn t  make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes   br    br   the voices  oh  those horrible  wretched voices  akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard  each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill  nasal vocals  cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel  vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew  and timmy s dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host  guy smiley from  sesame street  comes to mind   br    br   the animation is awful  even the producers of  yu gi oh   laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show  every character has buck teeth  or a square head  or a head three sizes too big for his or her body  and what s with having the characters speak every single line wide eyed and grinning  as though posing for a photo op with the president  then  there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic  not since the subtle grace of amelia bedelia  homer simpson  and buddy lembeck of  charles in charge  fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb  usually  unrealistic  is synonymous with  unfunny   and that is most definitely the case here  there hasn t been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since  the naked gun 33 1 3    and at least leslie nielson was good at it  br    br   finally  the premise of the show  and it s the same every single episode  so big time spoiler alert here   timmy wishes for something with his two  fairly oddparents   something goes wrong  there s always some contrived reason why he can t immediately reverse course and wish away the damage  and then everything turns out just fine in the end  oh  and on a side note  timmy s parents never believe him when he complains about vicky  and they continue to employ her at every opportunity  maybe it s just me  but it seems that a kids  show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn t a great idea   br    br   if you re writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen   the fairly odd parents  has to be a great place to start  a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0888019,i must say  when i read the storyline on the back of the case  it sounded really interesting  but when i started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end  some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062159,rodney dangerfield isn t the main character of this movie  he s barely in it  most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes  one running gag is that a character is named jerk off  there are also lots of erection jokes  where the punch line is someone has an erection  this movie is as funny as kirstie ally s british accent is convincing  br    br   this movie started off like a weak action movie  five minutes of back story and then bam  unfunny jokes  but  aside from the terrible writing  the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible  also  this movie does the old bad comedy clich  of having lots of well known b movie actors  harland williams  gilbert godfried  randy quaid  and phil la mar  these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney  even though he s billed as the main character  don t be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks  even that is too much 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326901,i m never much for classic films  movies like patton  going my way  how green was my valley  the godfather  casablanca  annie hall  gone with the wind  lawrence of arabia  and citizen kane bore me  however  i would much rather watch any one of those films 3 469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever  if i did the latter  i d probably be sleeping the entire time  br    br   the color art direction and the music didn t interest me  gershwin or non gershwin  the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep  the dialogue doesn t match up to singin  in the rain  basically  this movie is boring  the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid  but you can t blame me  i only slept 5 minutes the night before  br    br   1 star 10  too bad we can t give zeroes  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441,the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene   the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial   the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he s going to spend the rest of his life in jail   he s going to be out of circulation either way   didn t the cia have a chance before he was arrested   if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him   there s no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison  br    br   since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire   dial s colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they re driving in crashes but dial manages to escape   so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash   the film of this type of plot connivance   later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying   this airport is surrounded by armed coppers   yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation   the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained   this includes an important supporting character called emily day   why does she help dial even though he s a wanted fugitive   your guess is as good as mine  br    br   this is a fairly poor thriller and don t be taken in by the   big name   cast   wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films   charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again he s someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days   and he s basically playing a cameo role anyway   the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they l certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505,yuck  and again i say   yuck  the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory  the original movie had a lot to say and didn t go out of its way to say it  and  it had a naked chick on a motorcycle  br    br   this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest  it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute  the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance  it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife  br    br   there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314930,i found this movie boring  monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried  shallow  upbeat  ending that didn t ring true to the overall story  following these characters through a weekend of awful events  unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn t my idea of a watchable  interesting movie and i got very tired of its  one note  theme and couldn t wait for it to end  in fact i almost stopped about halfway through  the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering  and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant  though the acting was good  a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal  sorry  but it just didn t make it with me  and i love good  small films  this one just didn t jell  though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would  i was disappointed  especially after two local reviewers put it on their  year s 10 best  list  i d strongly recommend watching  the house of sand  instead  now there s a good  small film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925306,this is the page for  house of exorcism   but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece   lisa   the devil   which explains the ridiculously high rating for this   house of exorcism   when  lisa   the devil  was shown at film festivals in the early 70 s  it was a critical success  audiences responded well to that gorgeous  gothic horror film  unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it s time  and was considered too unusual  and not commercial enough for mass consumption  no distributor would buy it  so producer alfredo leone decided to edit  lisa   seemingly with a chainsaw  by removing just about half of the original film  and adding new scenes  which he filmed two years after the original product  it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new  hideous additions  so technically  house of exorcism  is not a bava film  the original product is a slow  dreamy  classy production  a few minutes into the film  the viewer is jarred out of this dream world  as suddenly we see lisa   two years older  and with a very different haircut   begin to writhe on the ground  making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like  suck my co k   etc  subtle  huh  and the film continues like this  jumping back and forth between a beautiful  visual film  and a grade z  exorcist  rip off  leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes  while keeping some semblance of a story intact  he failed miserably  when the choice was made to basically destroy  lisa and the devil   bava himself refused  saying that his film was too beautiful to cut  he was right  and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet  it was many years before the original  lisa and the devil  was seen again  re surfacing on late night television  i had seen  lisa  long before i saw this new version  and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films  vandalised  in this way  worth seeing only for curiosity sake  otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116,visually stunning  most definitely  i have seen few films look this good in some time  sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography  computer graphics  and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh  the time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s  the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason  also  mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide  who can stop them and save the world  alright  it doesn t take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead  and in the wings his trusty  thoroughly competent sidekick  what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization  the plot for this film is ridiculous  that being said  the film is going for a serial like feeling of film serials of yesteryear  they had pretty far out stories and bad acting   but none of them  and i mean none of them  had the budget and big names this film had  two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film afloat  one would think  but sky captain sinks miserably  despite its fantastic dark look  i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life  i had little interest in a story that generated little interest  i didn t care at all for any of the glib portrayals  paltrow was just awful  jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance  law cannot carry the one liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders  i mean  let s face it  he s not will smith  mel gibson  or even wesley snipes  the sad thing about sky captain  at least for me  was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little  i was bored ten minutes into the film   waiting for something to hook my interest   and it never came 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488147,once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent  reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town  br    br   low key  often to the point of blandness   action  comedy mostly just doesn t work  part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero  he s not bad  but he s really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy  as i said he s not bad  he s just just miscast for what his back story is  the real problem here is the combination of the script  which really isn t funny and seems artificial at times  and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness  there is no life in the way things are set up  its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list  it makes for an un engaging film  and yet the film occasionally springs to life  such as the in the final show down that ends the film  that sequence works  but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power  br    br   i can t really recommend the film  its worth a shot if you re a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms  but otherwise this is just a disappointment 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785007,this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized  there are two routes to take in horror films  either you don t really explain what s going on  or who the killer is  like in texas chainsaw massacre  or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained  halloween could potentially be an example of this   br    br   unfortunately  creep fails in this area  i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation  no character is fully realized  although the circular nature of kate s character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story  br    br   in the end  this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film making that drag down the film  br    br   this film will go down as another example of a film  as most are  that could be so much better even though it would never be great  the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting  the characters  story  direction  and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift  br    br   creep does serve a purpose as a mindless  silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment  but sadly  that s about it   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347591,i ll say one thing about this film  there are no lulls  you can t get bored watching this  the problem is that it is too intense  there is too much action and it needs lulls  that is the risk you take in modern action films  you want it interesting but not overdone  this is way overdone  br    br   even though the acting is fine and features a couple of  names  in gary busey and roy scheider  it still has the feel of a  b  film  the best part of it is scheider s dialog  the only  a  part of this  b  film  br    br   the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes  one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines  that was memorable  not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486321,this movie was terrible i rented it not knowing what to expect i watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb the acting was bad and there was no plot the monster is soooooo fake it growls and its mouth doesnt move also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster just plain bad don t even waste your time  1 out of 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770810,i can t believe this is on dvd  even less it was available at my local video store  br    br   some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000  budget  i find this funny  i would find it very bad whichever the budget  br    br   still more funny  i read the following in another review   dramatics aside  if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel  1971  updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in  you ll love this movie   br    br   what    this is a shame comparing those two movies  br    br   i give a  1   since i can t give a  0   i just don t see any way this movie could be entertaining 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384814,i just got through watching this dvd at home  we love westerns  so my husband rented it  he started apologizing to me half way through  the saddles  costumes  accents  everything was off  the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn t shoot the  collector  with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy s soul  his only excuse was  he only had 2 arrows left   we watched it all the way through  and  as someone else said   too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked  i mean  the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found  what s the point of that  and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around  if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers  this may be your movie  however  if you want a real western  you will hate this movie

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478365,this was longer than the ten commandments  all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined  my oh my  what a nightmare  this is the single biggest over hype of 2006  there is not a moment that is not scripted and clich d  movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer  dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture  in the form of endless music montages  shoddy acting  and poor directing choices  seriously  mr  condon  did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots  it s at  58  no wait  look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again    and again    and again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272950,to be honest  i didn t watch all of the original  howling   but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie  so great  that seven horrible sequels had to be made  they started off with  howling ii  your sister is a werewolf   i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new  i just watched it last night  and it wasn t really bad  it was just weird  i mean  the whole thing with sybil danning going three way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing  but kinda hot   christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she s a vampire  etc  actually  this movie was actually like some sort of mish mash of dracula and the lost boys   except with werewolves  because everything christopher lee  whom played dracula himself  was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie  stake in the heart  garlic  the creature of the night must die at night  and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania   not much for the acting  but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe  i swear  at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out  because that damn throat always had to say something  anyway  the plot is pretty silly and clich d  so there s no real point in telling you  you could just read about it on wikipedia  by the way  the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it s the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original  not counting howling iv  1988   which was a remake of the original  or in other words  a sequel based on the same novel   so don t see this movie  there s no real horror  hardly any werewolves  and just horrible special fx  3 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398027,i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all  the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time  there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers  this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world  from the notes  i can see that it s been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen  i can agree with their decision  avoid this show at all costs  it s terrible and ridiculous 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787475,terrible acting  lame plot  stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk  it was excruciating to sit through  just awful  do not waste one penny on this  the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch  this  horror  film was not even in the least bit scary  creepy or disturbing  it was in no way visually appealing  the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor actress opening their mouth  plus the entire story  i don t know why someone would make a movie with this story again  do not waste your time or money  even if it s a free ticket don t waste one moment viewing this movie  you will feel dumber for watching it

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330489,wow this one sucks  i m gonna sum it up as quickly as possible   br    br   a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle  a bunch of nothing happens for a long time  some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen  some girls get their heads cut off  off screen  the end  br    br   the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes  some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue  and a few brief nudie shots  and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is  in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage  as everyone else has noted  the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there s absolutely no bloodsucking  nor dancing of any sort in the film at all  it may as well have been called  the goat raper leads the circle jerk  and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film  an accurate title would have been  90 minutes of torture  another alluring title that would have at least been truthful   for the viewer  honestly the trailer that s on the disc shows all the best parts  and i use the term  best  extremely loosely     so i highly suggest watching that instead if you re still curious   i can t imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf  2 10 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176269,there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it s not very good  limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal  the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney s kim possible   brendan  the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible  background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark  yet by today s standards  overall it is still poor and cheap looking  many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80 s  nice in its own way but for modern child audiences  used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind  is sure to disappoint  the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren t overly impressive  noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part  there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clich  and stereotypically racist  however  some of the characters are good  the viking villains  although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound  there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together  the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay  the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic celtic anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look  the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner  including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive  best of all though is the music  much of the background music is melodic and moving  specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers  if the whole film was as poetic as this moment   and it tries   then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience  but instead it isn t a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn t stand up to modern animation standards  overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways  but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment  oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time  not sure how that was possible

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215835,it s boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one  not because it s abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzi s honor disappoints  some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i don t buy it  only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano  a dark character study set in mexico  that ranks among the finest he ever did  prizzi s honor on the other hand  a film loaded with star power  good intentions and a decent script  proves to be a major letdown  br    br   the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90 s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake  the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it s trying to be  a romantic comedy  a crime drama  a gangster saga etc  jack nicholson  doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack  and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode  just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts  anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character s motivations  she starts out the victim of her bigot father s disdain  she proves to be supportive to her ex husband  then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate  br    br   the colours of the movie have a washed up quality like it was made in the early 70 s and huston s direction is as uninteresting as everything else  there s promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could ve been morphed to something better but what s left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034486,even 20  years later  ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through  scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene  fire their obnoxiously noisy sub machine guns with wild abandon  and then silently leave  wow  how will we find those silent invisible assassins  just follow the shell casings and smoke painfully bad dialog  or was it brilliant and just poorly translated    not an asian in sight in the cast  and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew  the plot is ridiculous  the acting pretty much non existent   then again  ninja can t act  save yourselves   avoid watching at all costs 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448075,this movie was awful in the worst way  you just didn t care  you didn t care what happened in the plot  you didn t care about the characters  everyone was devoid of heart  i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn t want to subject my mind to it any more  there is far too much sex in the film  sex can be okay  it can even make the movie  hence karma sutra  but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy  it was just ugly  don t see this film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038046,there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof  it reminds you just how bad bad can be  we often see films which we describe as  pretty awful  or  not much good   but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren t  good  they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof  this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru  the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation  i e  to give me a present   it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn t  this is so utterly clich d  so badly written  so poorly directed  so badly acted that i m surprised everyone involved hasn t been arrested and sent down for 10 years  god  it s awful  i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in  but carried on because sometimes   sometimes   bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable  this isn t one of them  it is simply bad  i stopped watching after 45 minutes  and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082279,i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film  i wasn t drawn in for even a second  the characters were all one dimensional  they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick  i would bet  and hope  that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment  there are some great actors here but you would never know it  thank god it didn t destroy morgan freeman s or judd hirsh s or nick nolte s or laura dern s careers  there was no vision  no labor of love here  only a horrible effort gone wrong  btw i don t think the writer ever set foot in a real school 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052646,666  the child starts as a plane crashes  the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named donald  boo boo stewart  who is adopted by news reporter erika  sarah lieving    her cameraman husband scott lawson  adam vincent  after they covered the incident for channel 6 news  at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around  after warnings from a nun   vicar scott begins to believe that donald is evil   the cause of all the deaths    br    br   this straight to dvd horror flick was directed by jake perez under the pseudonym jake jackson   one has to say 666  the child is really rather poor  whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried  i get very worried since their track record is awful  they seem to specialise in making   or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip offs of some recent successful big budget horror film   in the case of 666  the child you don t need a degree in rocket science to realise that it s a complete rip off to cash in on the recent the omen  2006  which was released the same year  the script by benjamin henry   austin laurel is terrible   simply can t match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent  i mean just what exactly does donald the antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town  it s hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it  every character in 666  the child is some form of the main character s from the omen  the adopted parents  the priest who tries to warn them   the sinister babysitter  there s a real lack of incident  there s barely any gore   the plot is poor  i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random   needless  what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about  where did the babysitter come from   there s just nothing that ties everything together   it s just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly  the references to the number 6 also becomes annoying   are very unsubtle  br    br   director perez does alright i suppose  it s competent if nothing else  there s virtually no blood or gore  there s a few sprays of blood  a cut off hand   someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen  it s certainly not scary  there s no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house   there s no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do   there fore there s no threat from him  br    br   technically the film is alright  it s reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference  the acting isn t that great but at the same time i ve seen worse  br    br   666  the child is a poor mans the omen rip off  i d sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week  not good   definitely not recommended  followed by the sequel 666  the beast  2007  which also went straight to dvd 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112056,i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better  don t get me wrong  it s not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it s potential  the premise is good  the cast is great  i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton  and  god love  em  you can tell everyone tried their best  it just falls short over and over again   brutal massacre  should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and  despite the fact he makes it look easy  you should probably just forget trying to do the same  naughton and brian o halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often   they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me  if you re going to have the  spinal tap  of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made  spinal tap  to helm it   just thinking out loud there 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049287,quite honestly  the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time  during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat  trying to decide if i should demand a refund  but since i hadn t paid to see it in the first place  passes   i figured i might as well stay  and i didn t think it could possibly get any worse  br    br   it did  i will quickly run through the low points  includes some spoilers   the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane  a motivational speaker with two phds  the characterization was inconsistent  for example  lane  despite his credentials  is a complete nitwit  then there s the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies  we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code  also  terrible  action  sequences  lane escapes from tough situations without explanation  and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger  it turns out to be a dream sequence  that s cute for grammar school writing assignments  but it s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture  the pacing was bad  after a long opener  the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds  later  the pacing improves  but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around  and as someone else mentioned  years pass yet no one  not even lane s young daughter  ages  that was disconcerting  br    br   there are a few good things  though  the quality of the film  e g  lack of graininess  is high and very attractive  the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism  also  there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god  finally  to help him   this proved to be quite exhilarating   even to me  someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior  but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie  unfortunately  it was followed by major incomprehensibility  br    br   the characters  dialogue  direction and acting were all poorly done  michael ironside had nothing to do  and michael york was just weird  i think the producers wanted to do too much  if the plot had been tighter and more focused  and the characterization more fleshed out  the film would have been far better   br    br   in a nutshell  the omega code disappoints  definitely do not pay to see this  i give it    out of ten stars  br    br   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272147,i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago  first  i m going to say that it looks great  cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer  i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks  i would not call this a horror movie  putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie  there s no mystery  there s no suspense  you know who did it the entire time   br    br   it s a drama  you know what s going on with both sides the entire movie  the acting was okay  i guess  but nothing special  br    br   and the tagline   revenge can be deadly     really    they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same tagline  br    br   it pains me to say some of this  but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie  and i know they don t want people blowing smoke up their ass  so i give my honest opinion 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080486,great cast  great acting  unpredictable story line for the first half br    br   hour or so  i was really wanting to know what was going to br    br   happen to each of these unredeeming characters  and how their br    br   seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined  but when br    br   the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players  they br    br   mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill br    br   for the last two hours  i kept thinking it would get better  but it only br    br   got worse  don t believe the reviews  this is a waste of time   br    br   think about it    tom cruise made ugly    why  the gorgeous br    br   hunky bartender wearing braces    why  i know it had to do with br    br   the plot  but without them  at least there would have been one br    br   attractive cast member to remember 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077742,this movie is by far the worst movie ever made  if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don t make the damn film  i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie  adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace  watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender  anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime  if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it  i d give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462053,the motion picture was  in all likelihood  made in the year 1930 and released in 1931  i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era  nevertheless  this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak  also  gary cooper was probably just learning to act  the result is something that would not be acceptable by today s standards  for 1931  maybe  for 2004  not acceptable  some of the actors performed well  sadly  the indians always get the short end in these early westerns  they were living on the land long before the white man came  but according to twisted history  they had no right to defend themselves 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106669,this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller  a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies  they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables  the plot changes constantly  one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter  the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90 000 dollars  the dialogue is horrible  br    br   please don t watch this movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194218,this show had a lot of hype but i didn t know about it until the midseason  season 1   someone even recommended the show to me  but i decided that if i was going to watch it  i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk  due to the show s format  i m happy i waited  i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story  br    br   somehow  this show has managed to throw in too much sex  jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves  right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed  he s in bed with another woman the next night  then tara and sam get it on  despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie  and for some reason  sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it  even though she s sleeping with a vampire  one of the problems with the show  is that it doesn t do a good job of making you care about the characters  i really didn t care for jason at all  along with his endless pursuit of tale  he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him  after a few episodes  i wouldn t have minded if he got killed somehow  for that reason  i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie s grandmother became a victim  since the first two were more closely involved with jason   br    br   then once sookie and bill have sex  the story gets a few more subplots  tara s mother wants an exorcism  then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon  i wasn t so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff  however  they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about  1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother  at other points  some of the developments happen too fast  jason continues being a jerk  trying to sell his grandmother s stuff to buy vampire blood  which apparently is the new crack or something  in his search he finds this girl who will do v  vampire blood  with him  they get high  and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v  another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal  he s only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks  vampire politics  are more important than her  br    br   subtlety is not this show s strong suit  it doesn t take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog  although my assumption wasn t dead on  it wasn t that much of a surprise  but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn t possibly figure the out for yourself  when tara gets into the car accident  the naked lady s face with the pig is clearly shown  and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout  as if that wasn t enough  they later show the lady again with the pig at her house  then it s time to wrap up the murder story  at the end of the penultimate episode  it s revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer  in the final episode  they shove renee being the killer in your face  sookie remarks that it s odd that renee s thoughts don t have an accent  i thought that was fine  as it adds to renee being a fraud  but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee  they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fianc e finds a tape in one of renee s boxes about how to fake a cajun accent  at this point it was just ridiculous  i mean we get it    so blah blah blah stuff happens  bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie  who still manages to kill renee  they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues  the naked pig lady and sam have a history  lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed  jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church  which makes me care about him even less  br    br   it s almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show  i think i just expected this show to be better  i m interested in seeing what happens in season 2  but if i watch it  i ll most likely wait for the season completion 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312528,i ll admit  i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in  unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin  the avengers  and this one  br    br   this has to rank as the worst movie i ve ever seen   yes it ranks even lower than the avengers   everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief   br    br   even if you think uma is a goddess like i do  please please don t subject yourself to this movie  you ll hate yourself the following morning for it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094868,when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv  i was really looking forward to it  i grew up in the 1980 s and like everyone else who has grown up in that era  have seen every 80 s teen and summer camp movie out there  so i couldn t wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre  what a disappointment   the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over  with hardly any plot and no substance  and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed some of these so called jokes didn t come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive  the only good things about this film were the wardrobe  music  and acting  it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80 s  and the same goes for the music  and the acting was top notch throughout  almost all of hollywood s best comedians were present  too bad they didn t have better material to work with 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167456,if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema  if you ve never seen a  moving picture  before  you ll think this movie is a child of the gods  but if you ve seen a movie  a tv show  even barney the dinosaur  then you won t be very impressed by this film  heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick  br    br   now i like b movies  i just watched  the giant gila monster  right before i watched this swill  and i liked that movie much better  it works as a b movie  it has lamer dialog hokier acting  cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster  carno 3 just doesn t pack much of a b movie punch  it has some gore  and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming  almost    flaccid  it s the little engine that couldn t of dinosaur movies  i m not saying you shouldn t watch the movie   br    br   some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained  if you re one of those people  then give this movie a shot 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482021,ok hollywood is not liberal  br    br   obviously i m lieing because it is  im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie  this movie was anti bush  anti middle east   anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad  br    br   fist off i will give credit where credit is due  i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage  the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good  br    br   the plot was impossible for me to decode however  i have been tested and have an iq of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what  br    br   the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized  br    br   unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story  which it very well may be  i have no idea exactly what was going on  br    br   which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique  if you cant dazzle them with brilliance  then baffle them with bull s 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314766,i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old  i was a huge comic book reader at the time  and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily  the end result  however  was underwhelming  br    br   i was aware of the  emma peel  diana prince stories  as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form  however  there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie  the final costume was an interesting idea  but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero  br    br   i saw the movie again in my late teen years  it hadn t improved much  cathy lee crosby was more familiar  thanks to that s incredible  but her acting was no better  the script had a few good ideas  like the rogue amazon  and a decent villain in ricardo montalban  but it just didn t come together and was still boring  br    br   i think they should have built the back story better  and built the show into a more epic climax  it was too much like a bland spy film  crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book  the amazon elements were intriguing  but needed to be expanded  br    br   the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful  if a bit too camp and low budget  the budget was also pretty low here  and superheroes don t come cheap  br    br   it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd  if only as a comparison and historical document  even superman 4 is available  and it has nothing over this film  except chris reeve and gene hackman   it s worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455829,what a fantastic premise  a movie about the berlin airlift  it should have it all  tragedy  suspense  comradeship  rivals  berliner frauleins and tough us pilots  love and tears  what we ve got  is a film with none of the above  heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so  but he fails miserably  he acts so wooden  that at any given moment he should crack  he tries to play the tough guy  instead of being a tough guy  why would bettina zimmermann s character fall in love with him  cause they were throwing stones in a lake  cause he brings her coal bricks  the sfx are very  very well done  too much though  the hundreds or so planes over berlin  look like an attack fighter formation squadron rather than an organised airlift   as it actually was  interestingly enough  the white house  the kremlin  and general lucius d  clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set  notice the same drapes  hanging deep down the windows  as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout  why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty  by the way  general lucius d  clay  comes across as a small time  insecure  looser general  who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift  he was very much the opposite  so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion  no suspense and no historic accuracy  sad  it started out so promising
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247804,i m writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie  whilst it s not the worst i ve seen  it certainly isn t good  br    br   a weak script  weak actors  and weak directing  even if they can t afford big name cast  would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress  it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance  the story was a clich  and poorly scripted  the special effects were minimal  the  suspense  tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow  br    br   to be fair  dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors  episodes  but not quite on par with quality movies yet  dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don t want to miss any movie in the genre  even if it s a poorly made one  as for anyone else  time should be spent on something more valuable   which should be extremely easy 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084133,i had heard some bad things about cabin fever almost as much as i heard the cultish hype  as it turns out  the first film from the new impresario eli roth  it s just a so so effort with the iq points dropping as the film progresses  there are worse movies out there  and surely more gory ones  while i m not sure how the hype meter got so high on the blood count for hostel  there is a good amount for genre fans here   the premise isn t necessarily bad either though  kids go to a cabin for a week of partying  only to come across a very sick man  covered in blood  whom in a panic they set on fire  he winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir  and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh eating virus one way or another  the characters  either the lead college kids  including rider strong as the hero and james dibello as the goofy side bar  or the supporting  village  folks are archetypal to the point of inertia  if not painfully so   br    br   as they meet their fates  the townspeople get pretty weird  and it just seems to be non sensibly thrown together without the many laughs   pancakes kid  comes out of nowhere  and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself  but in the context of the rest of the movie  it just doesn t work  there s also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others  and the family that goes after dibello following an incident has some possibilities that aren t realized  but all the while  roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around  which isn t all for not either  now  unlike lesser troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s  to which i m sure roth is a die hard fan  he doesn t make it unwatchable  it s also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from   br    br   but unlike those films too  he also doesn t really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy horror times  his film tries for that  of course  and only once or twice does he make it a goofy  bloody time  i did like the random bunny strong sees while on the gurney   it s not even very poorly shot a lot of the time  albeit with its own contrived style choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling alley worker   it simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made  shave your legs with a deadly virus  uh huh   and it aims for fairly typical ground  if that s your cup of tea  more power to you  but at the end i found it to be actually un exceptional genre territory that doesn t offend audience sensibilities ala saw  but doesn t swing for the fence either as a clever b movie  roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of  what the hell  as the santa claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people  it could work if he followed up on it with something better  or if he dropped it altogether  same could be said for a lot of the movie  c

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272620,monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory  are there any else in hollywood   polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women  james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul mouthed boss barnes who himself can t keep his hands off of his secretary s rear to get to the bottom  pun intended  of the story  while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america  i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns  there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which  by the way  also supplies the town with jobs for the locals  but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy feely enviro marxism  pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex girlfriend on the beach  tells her that he is seeing the mayor s daughter juanita and it s over between them  then she is promptly eaten that night  a little side action without the evidence  my hat is off to you sir  john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners  you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face  might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn t bounce  br    br   supposedly based on a true story  so much so they say it twice in the opening credits  this film is awful on all fronts  filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters  even putting his daughter  andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine  the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming  this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night  the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending  james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed  utterly unwatchable dreck  shame on you john carradine 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421239,the plot of this film is not strong at all  lots of holes  if you approach it as a car movie its not bad  lots of great cars in this one  the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed  i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st  cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89  its an interesting historical piece for us locals  seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it  it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs  had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town  i didn t know the director was from st cloud 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405507,in fact  it never was  i m not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy  what a vacuous shambles  none of these people come close to a cary grant  spencer tracy  katherine hepburn  etc  and anyway  today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck  writing is trivial  the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious  the chemistry between the leading characters is non existent  it s interesting that julia roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the  golden age of hollywood   whenever that may be  it s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191121,i honestly had no idea that the notorious b i g   bert i  gordon the director  not the murdered rapper  was still active in the 80 s  i always presumed the deliciously inept  empire of the ants  stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre  but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of  the coming   a totally obscure and unheard of witchery movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise  what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day salum  massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum  for you see  this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state  the man who attacked loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge  but poor and three centuries older loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl   or is she   burned at the stake  unfolds like a mixture between  the exorcist  and  witchfinder general  with a tad bit of  the time machine  thrown in for good measure  way to go  bert  the plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom  like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like  the dunwich horror  and  the devonsville terror   the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692  which keeps it rather amusing and fast paced  the ann putman girl is quite a fascinating character  reminiscent of the abigail williams character in the more commonly known stage play  the crucible   also depicted by winona ryder in the 1996 motion picture   there are a couple of cool death sequences  like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library  that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with ann putman and perhaps even the devil himself  the film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end  but overall there s some good cheesy fun to be had  plus  the least you can say about bert i  gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112765,when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider  are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way  this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society  when a comedian actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves  do i want to support that behavior   in this case mr  foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong  good behavior from bad that loving kindness is better than hatefulness  mr  foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from  saying sorry does not get him off the hook  it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth  one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it  no longer see anything they are part of  we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084395,the problems with this film are many  but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones  first of all  while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life  the reality was that everything  as usual in movies and tv  was about something bizarre  usually of a sexual nature  the story lines were thin or nonexistent  and virtually every scene  camera shot  line of dialog  and expressed emotion was absolutely  and totally fake  it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out  something no uncommon for me in recent years   i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program  but i believe the  at one time  pre amelia  talented director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty  so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473356,the author of numerous novels  plays  and short stories  w  somerset maugham  1874 1965  was considered among the world s great authors during his lifetime  and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public  published in 1944  the razor s edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values  it was maugham s last major novel  and it was immensely popular  given that the novel s conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues  it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version  but darryl f  zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication  br    br   according to film lore  the razor s edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himself  and it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation  when the film went into production  however  cukor was replaced by edmund goulding  a director less known for artistic touch than a workman like manner  and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti  the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident  tyrone power  recently returned from military service during world war ii  was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell  gene tierney  one of the great beauties of her era  was cast as socialite isabell bradley  the supporting cast was particularly notable  including herbert marshall  anne baxter  clifton webb  lucille watson  and elsa lanchester  both budget and shooting schedule were lavish  and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike  br    br   but time has a way of putting things into perspective  seen today  the razor s edge is indeed a beautifully produced film  but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity  as in most cases  the major problem is the script  although it is reasonably close to maugham s novel in terms of plot  it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story  we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment  we are told that he receives it  we are told he acts on it  but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual  artistic  philosophical  and intellectual processes behind any of it  we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself  it has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees  br    br   we are left with the shell of maugham s plot  which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell  a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them  tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent  but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support  unfortunately  that does not happen here  they are extremely one note and power is greatly miscast to boot  fortunately  the supporting cast is quite good  with herbert marshall  clifton webb  and lucille watson particularly so  the then famous performance by anne baxter  however  has not worn as well as one would hope  br    br   with a running time of just under two and a half hours  the film also feels unnecessarily long  there is seemingly endless cocktail party type banter  and indeed the entire india sequence  which reads as faintly hilarious  would have been better cut entirely  an odd situation  for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film  regardless of the specific scene  it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point  br    br   as for the dvd itself  the film has not been remastered  but the print is extremely good  and while the bonus package isn t particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor  when all is said and done  i give the razor s edge four stars for production values and everyone s willingness to take on the material  but frankly  this a film best left power and tierney fans  who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars  and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself  br    br   gft  amazon reviewer
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184027,not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc  but easily the worst  never seeing the light of day  the director is not even canadian  but british  and boy does it show  we are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons  the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent  and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk  of course the british character is normal  the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype   can you say  norm     the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes  the actors always seem to be fidgetting  are they as bored as the viewer  or is this the directors idea of cinema  avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films  a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically  you won t be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207051,      possible spoiler       br    br   you d think a story involving archie grey owl   an englishman posing as a red indian   would have a massive amount of humour involved   in fact i d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy   however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama   worse   he s made an extremely dire film too   pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony   played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau   lacks any type of on screen chemistry   but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he s a native american   the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman   that s why i wrote   possible spoiler   it s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english   but it s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there s absolutely no surprise involved  br    br   yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn t actually a new concept   theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told   and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green   and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message   that there hasn t actually been a great ecological film   in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl   a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0336325,i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great  so i went out and bought it  what a mistake  the acting is a shambles  the special effects  if you could call them that   look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play  some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen  which unfortunately is all to often  as for a story  forget it  this is a warning  don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen  if  for some reason  you like this film watch troll 2  you will probably enjoy that as well 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070795,already his first claim  that desires are always artificial  is totally fallacious  br    br   when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies   or anything for that matter   it s time for anyone to get their own  although far  far more intelligent than  say  paris hilton  i know  not too difficult  zizek s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers  just a different kind  he combines the worst from both his professional worlds  psychoanalysis and philosophy  both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls   osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories  to rant without a beginning or end  and to connect concepts almost randomly  in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love  example  there are three main marx brothers hence what a  great  idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness  the id  the ego and the super ego  i m kind of surprised he didn t play a clip from  snowhite  and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah  moslem hell   it s like the premise of schumacher s  the number 23   play with numbers long enough  and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want  even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death  br    br   however  there is an entertainment element to tpgtc  watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun  why watch  cuckoo s nest  or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours  it s like watching an amusing train wreck  admittedly  he is almost funny on one or two occasions  br    br   i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science  giving idiotic movies like  birds  this much thought  hence this much credit  probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave  the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value  and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them   unless one is a complete idiot  zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies  hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days    br    br   when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the  psycho  shower scene  i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes  how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood  or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina  with the blood flowing into it instead of out  as in menstruation   this representing some kind of  clever  zizekian  irony   speaking of which  the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene  and the script   his movies wouldn t have been the illogical  far fetched crap that they often are  the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about  hidden  deep meanings   and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology  layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations  you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated   i e  the easily impressionable and the gullible  br    br   zizek utters a number of  unintentionally  funny things here  one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with  the satisfaction of work  of a job well done   don t laugh    neither hitchcock nor the writer of  psycho  could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done   the cleaning of a blood stained toilet   while they were conceiving directing that scene  talk about putting words into one s  dead  mouth  but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to  say   br    br   i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific  solaris   but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in  anti feminism  and other nonsense into his theory  br    br   zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone   i just want to play with it all day   logic has its rules  and is not supposed to be raped   at least not publicly   by the likes of him  he seems to regard logic  proof  common sense  and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys  concepts to be either avoided  twisted to fit the end goal  or simply annihilated  zizek is the lsd tripped hippie  and all his favorite movies are his own personal  2001 s  br    br   the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors   and ones whose films often lack intelligence  if anything   such as hitchcock and lynch  only further diminishes his already low credibility  i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently  that s another lame director who writes inept scripts  zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible  lost highway   there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it  br    br   zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable   ground breaking  physical set up in  dogville  made me snicker   br    br   however  zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along  he also indulges heavily in the  bleedin  obvious   like all  social scientists   an oxymoron   he wraps his very trite  observations  into articulate  if full of spitting  and sometimes complex blankets of language  after all  sociology functions in precisely the same way  it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know  but told in an eloquent way   which fools the more unobservant listener  br    br   i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305396,the bfg is one of roald dahl s most cherished books  but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn t there  this version remains pretty faithful to dahl s original story so one can t lay the blame on john hambley s script  if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation  the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice overs  one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy  vibrant  fun filled movie      instead  the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch  children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first  all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children s  classic  br    br   young orphan sophie  voice of amanda root  lives in a none too friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers  one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street  the figure realises it has been seen  so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed  placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night  sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country  and fears that he will eat her  but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg  voice of david jason   the bfg refuses to eat people  instead restricting himself to foul tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers  however  giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast   every night  as it happens   on poor unsuspecting humans  sophie and the bfg become great friends  and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants  together they go to the queen of england  voice of angela thorne  with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants  the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else  br    br   jason voices the bfg quite well  one of the few pluses in the film  but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality  the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired  with very little to bring the characters to life  similarly  the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated   sophie lacks appeal  and the giants are boringly designed  and look almost indistinguishable from each other   even the places are uninventive  giant country especially comes up short  being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons  at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy  yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences  little of dahl s mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily  one chapter in the book deals with the bfg s love of  whizzpopping   farting  and is laugh out loud hilarious  in the film  the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling  i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest  fun and enjoyment  but what i got was pretty much the opposite  this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn t match the calibre of the book in any department   unfortunately  therefore  it must go down as one to skip 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304711,of all the movies i ve seen  this one rates almost at the bottom  haunted mansion  nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom   it is hasty  the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted  of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer s door  the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous  and illogical  oprah gives a palatable appearance as  bigger s  mom  but is not nearly at her potential  other famous performers also seem to be at their worst  the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur  in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted  one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk  now the family he s working for are not against blacks  but he thinks they are  so when he comes home he puts her to bed  but she begins caterwauling  the blind mother  yes  hears this  so bigger tries to silence her  but instead smothers her  now fearing he s really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do  he shoves her into the coal furnace  so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace  the idiot didn t have the foresight to get rid of the ashes  he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom  if your desperate for a bad movie  this one could do the job  but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40 s and 50 s or see a good drama  there are a lot better options  avoid this

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421054,nothing in this film interested me  i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing  that s not laid back stanislofsky method  that s just walking through and saying lines  i m afraid  kidman s performance is sad  the story is  however  mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125546,films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning  while there are some exceptions  the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes  the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds  as they re both very annoying and they don t have an ounce of acting ability between them  in short  they re rubbish  this isn t good considering that they re the leads  and it especially isn t good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors  it s a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn t  not completely   it follows a young girl who  after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook  wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created  it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings  and so sets about making various changes  until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare  oh dear  br    br   as you can see  this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie  however  it is squandered through a number of fatal faults  first and foremost  in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness  the movie is extremely stale  the central plot is hardly played with at all  and the result is an entirely boring experience  the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie  as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don t care any more  which is due to a lack of ideas   thanks in part to it s lead characters  the film feels like a kids movie throughout  this is to be expected as it stars kids  but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story  as the horror in the movie is laughable at best  the film is also very cheesy  and the  romance  between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy  and makes for very painful viewing  in fact  if i had to sum this travesty up in one word  i would choose  painful   paperhouse is poorly acted  laughably plotted  very corny and dull on the whole  save yourself the pain  see something else

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403118,at first  three words  read the book  really guys   this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters  i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film  it was ludicrous  with half a heart and the story bad explained  the novel   in the first place    wasn t meant to focus on an adventure  that s only the surroundings  in the film  the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat  additional  the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious  they screwed it up      i ll never watch it again

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119792,this sure is one comedy i m not likely to forget for a while  br    br   wouldn t normally bother to comment on this movie  it s so minor that no one would watch it anyway  but as it happens  it s kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa  and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is  br    br   so what is it then  well  of course it s not really a comedy  instead  it s intended as a horror flick     intended  very much being the key word here  the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess  the special effects are only special in that they re especially pathetic  and as for the acting  well  let s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school  my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent  br    br   of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one s expectations  certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned  also  even though i m a big fan of the horror genre  i m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting  br    br   but still  br    br   b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding  such as humour  the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances  if you can find the humour in that  and i could for the first 20 minutes or so  gradually dozing off after that  then that s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer  oh  that and two or three pairs of breasts  br    br   woohoo  how exciting  br    br   as for the story  it s not even that it doesn t try to convey anything  the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime  the lesson  watch out  naughty boys and girls  because one day you ll be made to pay for what you ve done  br    br   i rest my case  br    br   so  all in all  a little bit of sex  a fair amount of drugs  but absolutely zero rock  n roll  br    br   i rate this one 1 out of 10  but would go to 0 if i could  or perhaps i wouldn t  it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors  names correctly in the titles  i mean  that s something  innit 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338075,well since seeing part s 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4  everything from the tacky  and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting  i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds  br    br   i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion  but without him around in this one it s just not the same  sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line s  but it was a good closure at the end of the third one  again there was no reason for a part 4  even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through  lol  there goes an hour and a half of my life i ll never see again

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086946,for me  this movie just seemed to fall on its face  the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer  i don t know whether this grows out of type casting or simply his demeanor  but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain  he s a good guy  and that s always obvious in his performances  other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story  nothing very innovative  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110443, absolute beginners  was a film for the younger generation  a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled  constantly hitting each note  teen s problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow  it could have been dubbed the  moulin rouge  of the 80s  but it disappeared  it made its very shallow mark on the world  snuck under the radar  and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section  the comedy section  or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn t need chain money to survive  alas  that wasn t where i found it   but i found it  watched it  tried my hardest to sing along with it  stared into bowie s eyes  but found myself faded by the end  did it not survive the test of time  is 1950s london too far removed from our current society  is bowie too creepy  i think  absolute beginners  falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang  but withers to a mere sparkle by the end  br    br    absolute beginners  opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly  prostitutes on every corner  dance throughout  booze like rivers  and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual  sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right  director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters  the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl  suzette  played by patsy kensit   these two have chemistry  and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan  to me they worked  there was a huge spark between them  the chemistry was like lava  and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled  i was ready   but then  something happened  temple takes us out of the nightlife  takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning  and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first  suzette runs away  colin becomes a pervert  and bowie  well  i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain   i can tell you that much  temple gives us this flashy city  this opportunity to see those that inhabit it  but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger  we learn about colin  mainly  but nobody else  i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom  and what importance fashion had to that era  also  were they teens really   they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s  but maybe it was my tv  br    br   character development thrown right out the door  temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger  more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about  one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example  temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin s parents  of which i didn t know it was them until after the film  and a song which screams apathy  great song  too many characters  not enough time  suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency  and it just falls apart in your hands  then  if that wasn t enough  we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs  rubbing our noggin  trying to understand where our characters are or are going  and temple throws in hatred  anger  and politics into the final act  while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme  i didn t think racism would be on the top of the bill  suddenly  friends are missing  people are angry  and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race  somebody help me out here  it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming   nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off  to me  the ending of  absolute beginners  was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number  that first part set the pace  and temple could not keep up  br    br   overall  i must say that temple can direct a music video  but i don t think he was quite prepared for the feature film  i don t think this film will ever make it into full  cult  status  and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come  it is a fun film to watch initially  but when we get to that final part  it just explodes from the inside  i wanted some cutting edge work  but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for  i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s  but by the end it just felt forced  i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to  motivation  by the ever freaky bowie in this film  it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status  i am glad that i watched this film once  but that is all that my small brain can take  i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning  but he couldn t control his characters  way too many   and the songs didn t seem to match the final moments of the film  it came out of nowhere  and it was unwelcomed  if this was a film about racism  it needed to be from the beginning   absolute beginners  was a welcomed adventure  but i don t think i will be dusting this film off in the future  br    br   grade     out of

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073601,sadly i don t remember the book anymore  but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace  this film represents a typical german production of low quality  it does not hold my attention   although the story itself is good  it is just badly adabted  at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated   they have no nuances in their performances  even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren t cannot rescue this poor spectacle  however there s hope     i ve been told that the films following this one are getting better and better  so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn t deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090585,first lesson that some film makers  particularly those inspired by hollywood  need to know   just  style  does not sell  i guess tashan when translated will mean style  second  if you are hell bent on selling style  that does not spare you from having a decent story  br    br   tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director  but it is not slick  for example  all three   saif  kareena and akshay   are narrators at different points in the story  but this setup is not utilized to properly  there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations  actions sequences are from the seventies  br    br   cheoreography of the film is awful  i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film  vishal shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film  why is there a sufi song  dil haara  in tashan  why is the cool hinglish song  dil dance maare  not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy   br    br   akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film  but he is in his stereotyped self  you won t mind missing this film 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089280,just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home  she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why  br    br   this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn t quite  i can t really put my finger on why it didn t work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better  or at least had gotten the little things right  like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size  i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106582,i ve been a fan since his first album  this film is a disservice to him  the performances  except for one by rufus wainwright and teddy thompson are simply terrible   br    br   those by martha wainwright  nick cave  antony  and jarvis cocker were particularly annoying  even the one by the mcgarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of martha wainwright  br    br   i ve never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and i found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments  which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work   br    br   there are many who have been able to interpret mr  cohen s songs  jennifer warnes  kd lang  billy joel  aaron neville  and willie nelson come to mind  but those people selected for this performance were just awful  br    br   hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing leonard cohen on film that will illustrate his insight  talent  and intelligence  br    br   so sad
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297827,extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel  the action is at best average  a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double   br    br   the set up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case  the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical  lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed  the action sequences are by the numbers and lee who would go on to make the excellent the crow  is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance  but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death  br    br   unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80 s style action movies  think cobra etc   then avoid  br    br   poor 3 10
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156789,it s hard to praise this film much  the cgi for the dragon was well done  but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow  also  the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious  br    br   i was amazed to see  marcus aurelius  in the acting credits  wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film  like  whoopie goldberg  it must be an alias  and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker  br    br   the story might been interesting  but the acting is flat  and direction is tedious  if you must watch this film  go around to your friend s house and get drunk while doing so   then it ll be enjoyable 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415141,i can t come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching ramgopal varma ki aag  the director s half hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western  sholay  the biggest problem with varma s remake is that he doesn t even try to make a credible film  it s evident in every single frame of this movie that varma s heart is just not in it  what you see on screen is a bad joke at best  a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker  and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he s been a fan of all his life i ve seen several bad films over the years  but i can t remember one that s been as much of a torture to sit through as this one  consider yourself very brave if you re able to survive the entire film  because it tests your patience like few films have before varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film  but his version is trite and hollow and doesn t have any of the spirit and energy of sholay  ramgopal varma ki aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not   way over the top  too long too boring  and entirely mindless  much loved moments from sholay are parodied by varma and for that you want to wring his neck  one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which dharmendra as veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay devgan playing hero  pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself  how you wish he d pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony not only does ramgopal varma ki aag fail as a remake of sholay  it s a pretty bad effort even as a stand alone film  the eardrum damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen  and the camera work alternates between dramatic and head spinning  partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film s mostly dead as wood actors  sushmita sen as devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously  punctuating her lines with pauses  staring into camera for effect  and generally performing like her life depends upon it  mohanlal as narsimha  struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career  newcomer prashant raj playing jai equivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and can t strum up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original film as hero  the new age veeru  ajay devgan is entirely hopeless  failing miserably in his attempts at comedy  but the film s weakest link  easily the most shocking casting decision is nisha kothari as ghunghroo  who steps into the shoes of hema malini as basanti  the endearing airhead from sholay  nisha kothari is not only the worst actress in this country  but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world  she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning  and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she s on screen  and then  there is amitabh bachchan playing babban singh  ramgopal varma s version of hindi cinema s most popular villain gabbar singh  the only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film s over the top tone and plays along accordingly  bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch  he s meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams  and he does all of that to good effect  but because he s trapped in such a doomed enterprise  his performance doesn t really help elevate the film in any way no surprises here  i m going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for ramgopal varma ki aag  it one s of those painful movie watching experiences you wouldn t subject even an enemy to  it s not like varma hasn t handled a remake before  with sarkar he gave us a smart  gripping take on the godfather  and it s a pity he s made this sholay bhature out of such a much loved classic  ramgopal varma ki aag is his worst career decision ever  it s also a dark spot on his resume he ll be embarrassed of forever  i suspect this film will go down in movie history as ramgopal varma ka daag

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033022,i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time  the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture  the dated aspect aside  jigsaw suffers from many problems  including overwrought acting  silly and stilted dialogue  lsd flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds  a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is  on paper  a great vehicle to do just that  and an ending that is so trite and predictable  not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows  that the climax is actually an anti climax  if it was a better movie  we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment  but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook  i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody s insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out  at very best  a three out of 10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176579,it is cheese  if all you want is a video game  complete with what look like straight from the computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for  this is it  my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it  since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit  this movie really requires heckling  br    br   plot  there was a plot  ok  some stupid college or later types get invited to  the rave of the year  and go to one of the san juan islands   if they d only stayed back in seattle  they would have survived     direct quote  or nearly   to attend  they get there and everyone is gone  and the site is somewhat wrecked  but hey  the keg is still full    with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman  who acted only slightly less tough   and slightly less well   than cynthia rothrock   they fight lots of zombies  some which spit acid   get an earful of freaky legends  and mostly get killed  that s about it  br    br   it s not quite as bad as demonicus  but not by much  and still better than severed  they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies   the former is bad but fun to heckle  and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once   on the other hand  if you re expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil  run away    run away now    br    br   ok  some real big questions  without too many spoilers   since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific northwest      why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns  and to whom   canada  for crying out loud    why is a rave on an unnamed  oh  excuse me  it s called  isla del muerto   shya  right  san juan island   and outdoors  still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet  and the rave has about 30 people in attendance    the rave of the year   my patoot  br    br   lucky thing there s lots of hatchets around  lots of them  everyone has them  must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby  br    br   finally  while the movie started out playing with a little  parody   with nudges at i know what you did and jaws   it didn t carry it through near enough  br    br   ok  really finally   when the introductory comments  in a voice over  no less  casually mention that one of the characters  gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing  you can be darn sure there ll be some fencing by the end of the movie  not good fencing  but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords  anyway 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123385,it s hard to believe an  action  packed jet li movie could be so boring  but this was transcendant trash  the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks  the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent   br    br   it s a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they re mentally unstable  one of their number  li  who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian  the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world  and li sheds his new life to save the world  br    br   the version i saw was dubbed  and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book 25 cent special effects  but i suspect even ninja turtle watching 8 year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119527,if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre  i would change my rating to an eight  try to imagine a movie where every scene  line  and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody  i could probably crap out alphabet soup  rearrange what was left of the letters  and still have a better script  two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie  spoiler alert  one is when mike s dad and the other dad walk  i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies  this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead  nothing happens to them  when they reach the end  the ex marine turns around  says  god you re a horny bastard   and shoots only one  the other is in the military complex  the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded  the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds  while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm s length away  she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans  spoiler alert over  these scenes must be seen to be believed  still  i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it s so damn funny  kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346156,this was my first  and probably the last angelopoulos movie  i was eager to get into it  as it featured mastroianni  one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo  of whom i ve heard a lot  the opening was promising  a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian greek border  ok  but that was all  nothing left  the movie had big holes and i don t know which to mention first  the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman  during a long walk  it s like a 15 minutes monologue  killing the action and viewers patience  nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes  apart this old lady telling a story  all that is presumed to be shown through action  was simply told to the camera by the old lady  in a moment  the equippe of tv was heading to the bar  they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins  probably  shot in different days  continuity leaked  a lot of problems with the story telling  it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style  making the viewer asking questions that never got answers  poor mastroianni  given a role which lacked integrity or charm  on the other hand  as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with  the movies showed lot of historic  ethnic  or politically incorrectness  just for the sake of making a movie about  humanity  as a red in another review  a lot more to say  but no time to lose on a poor movie  which was not movie at all  but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708446,a perfect little atrocity   i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary mtv 4 4 seconds  woeful casting  worse even than in kusminsky s version  a reminder  he managed to miscast juliet binoche and ralph feinnnes   but  hey the rich got what they deserved  dark and brooding heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden locked angel  frail and angellic catherine presented as a chubby  melon breasted heffer  meek and weak linton is a peeping tom  and innocent isabel becomes sara michelle gellar s character from cruel intentions  15 year old eddie bauer and abercrombie and fitch donners take notice  this thing was made for you  it is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you  you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters  but even from initial shock at their actions  the actors tried  but  as i stated before  they were miscasted  decent photography  but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school  i implore you all  read the book  or the cliffnotes even  watch the previous versions of it  even kusminsky s  but stay away from the numerous future reruns  during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial free premiere 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044872,contrary to most other comments about  syriana  on the imdb web site  i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space  br    br   in short  this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far  rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner  it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30 second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so  story lines  at the audience made for great and clear viewing  no  sir  it does not  what does make for great viewing is total clarity  precision  plots and story lines   and characterisations   which have a beginning  a middle  and an end  br    br   this kind of cinematic presentation   akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant   is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme  br    br   thank goodness  then  for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers  director  and actors knew the value of clear story telling  diction  and acting that meant something  br    br   this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0263005,i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale  having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can t lose  it if was rubbish then no loss  if it was any good then bargain    br    br   then i watched it    br    br   i am normally a fan of christopher walken  but in this film he commanded very little screen presence  seeming not to do a whole lot  even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the  action  in the plot seems to affect him very little  and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic  br    br   normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters  however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused  and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it s eventual conclusion    br    br   at this point i wept    br    br   i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to  the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful  although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl  the acting was poor all round  the script and story was weak  the  action  was even weaker  and the  visuals  were but bluntly not all that visual  to summarise there are films which are good  films that are bad  films that are so bad they are good  films that are terrible    br    br   and then on a whole new level is  mcbain 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101635,i will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about  to prevent it from happening again  i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk  the movie was pretty terrible  all clich   no real plot  historical and technical inaccuracies abound  look up the technical specs on de 529  or any everts class destroyer escort  and you will see what i mean  i now its black history month in the us  and im going to be called a racist just for saying this  but the history of this ship is not that great  they did some escort work  chased a  submarine  that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed  sorry  but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for  this movie makes them look like whiners  let the name calling commence  i can handle it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381966,disney has now made straight to video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features  two of these were made for their 1991 classic   beauty and the beast   well  these ones aren t really sequels  as they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straight to video films was  beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas   which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one   belle s magical world   is definitely inferior  br    br   the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is  the perfect word   where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is  fifi s folly   where fifi and lumiere s fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they re actually in love  the film ends with  the broken wing   in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds   br    br   the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney s third  beauty and the beast  movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called  mrs  potts s party   but i ve only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about  belle s magical world  is that the animation is very 2 dimensional compared to what we re used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn t like  beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas  that much  but you certainly can t say the same about its animation  i m sure the stories in  belle s magical world  could entertain many kids  mostly younger ones  i think   and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn t have a lot  i personally didn t find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way  they re not very well written   in  the perfect word   the way belle says to the beast   you re acting rude    and foolish   is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories  br    br   by the time this straight to video movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don t know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i never saw  beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas  until a couple months ago  but unlike that film  i never even heard of this one until recently  i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney s 1991 hit  well  as much as i like the theatrical original  i wouldn t have been missing much if i never became aware of this film s existence  for little kids  i m sure  belle s magical world  can be highly entertaining  and probably somewhat educational with its morals  but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102585,i watched full house when i was younger and i can not understand why i did  i don t remember really enjoying the show  i think i and the majority of americans watching this were hypnotized by its badness  it will put you in a trance state and there is no going back  i am still scarred but i try to move on  i know it s a family show but that does not mean it has to be so bad  the show is so clich  with every episode ending with a  talk  from the dad to make everyone s problems go away  the characters on the show are all loathsome  there is a know it all  cleaning obsessed  corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen  we then have a supposed  rocker  uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap  we have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame bullwinkle impressions  need i say more about him   there is the eldest daughter who can not act and is always whining about something  then a middle daughter who always says   how rude   to pretty much everything anyone says  finally  there is the youngest daughter michelle  do not get me started on michelle played but the horrible actors known as the olsen twins  if you believe in christianity i guess you would associate her with the antichrist  she is always demanding things  trying too hard to be  cute   is constantly saying  duh   and rolling her eyes which makes you want to smack her  i am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children  but in her case  i would make an acceptation  she needed it on a daily basis  she is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television  one example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic  the brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention  he yells at her and she gets upset  poor baby  the rest of the episode is catering to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually apologizes to her  ugghh  the show will lower your iq along with slowly destroying your will to live  i am surprised we don t hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide  do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show  you will thank me later 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463392,to be completely honest i haven t seen that many western films but i ve seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west  come on  who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly  no no  completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english  if the setting is western asia isn t where your going  finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don t get me wrong i m not racist or white either so don t get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097003,woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court  okay  that sounds all right there  it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story  but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film  this movie became redundant  retarded  and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by  woody harrelson played one of my favorite t v  characters  woody from cheers  and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie  but after seeing his   acting performance   i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend  his acting was as dull and poor as the movie  another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez  i have liked movies with perez before  but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn t have that many speaking lines   do the right thing    but now in white men can t jump she was made a central character with many lines  thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice  so after seeing this film   term used loosely   and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i m a white man and i m getting ready to jump       off a twenty story apartment building

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024320,     and after seeing this pile of crap you won t be surprised that it wasn t published  br    br        spoilers      br    br   this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it s one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is   the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror    br    br     my god   what happened here      br    br     i don t know but they sure hate cats     br    br   the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated   boy this guy is right   someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman   oh wait a minute   he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you re going to be watching a bad movie  br    br   the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it s very illogical and confused   we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive   would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town   having said that at least we know of the monsters motives   that s the only thing we learn   we never learn how they re able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator   monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun       but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible   the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats   if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden   there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them   i guess that s so the production team can come up with an ending   it was that they started the movie my complaint lies  br    br   we re treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis   clive barker and even stephen king make cameos   i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what   they weren t going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast   that s how bad sleepwalkers is br    br     unbelievable as it seems that wasn t the worst line in the movie   the worst line is     that cat saved my life  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369084,i had to stop watching this film  a pseudo intellectual product for pretentious film viewers  twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns  not to mention that i was soon near tears over the  3 99 i had wasted at blockbuster  joanna pacula s acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one s teeth  i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many  both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents  while we re on the topic of talent  breuer s supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe  she clearly has not learned her craft  in fact  she s really quite awful  all the public scenes looked staged  with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best  turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on  don t rent this terrible movie  you will be sorry you spent your money

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098089,normally i would have given this movie a 6  it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well   despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself  br    br   i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating  but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi  there s no dimension to her other than how confused  helpless and clueless she is  and how good she is at whimpering  i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught  scared and in pain  however  wright s entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling  the rest being whining  i couldn t help but feel this particular girl s problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia  but by her not having a backbone  i very much doubt that s the point the movie meant to make 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105011,it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance  however moronic this illogical  logic  may be  however within the story and theme of the film  there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film s antagonist  is the   villain of the story    under no circumstances can what she did be justified  sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality  it is betrayal of the ultimate sort  the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man s offspring  to top it all  the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3  liberated  female characters in the climax is pathetic  a woman s sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse  there are no other children  so in essence his life has been wasted  in some societies where justice still prevails  such situations result in the execution of the unjust 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097994,about halfway through  i realized i didn t care about these characters in the least  however  i watched a bit more anyway  regrettably  i came back the next day and finished it  i shouldn t have bothered  br    br   if you know  anything  about the film beforehand  you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor   and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what s gonna happen afterward   he s gonna get on the phone and call people about it  that was almost as bad as  snakes on a plane   another bad aviation catastrophe flick   br    br   i realize this is an old film  and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today  but even by those standards  the acting was embarrassing  these weren t characters  they were stereotypes  i suspect this movie was  more than anything  an attempt by bette davis to help her husband s  gary merrill  career  to no avail however   i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did  br    br   davis  playing the happy cripple  i e   a non glamorous role  was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move  it wasn t  it was just boring  she was a kind of tiny tim in the film  making trask  merrill s character  see the truth about love and forgiveness  although she was less winsome than tiny tim   calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died  br    br   the final scene  where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile  was so affected and over acted on both ends of the phone line  i almost cringed  i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film  br    br   i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie  if you found it uplifting   that s great  but frankly  i just found it bad  there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115387,this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made  true  most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad  but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible  there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary  it is typical king garbage    myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place  mixed with obvious and belabored so called  scares  that are about as shocking as peewee s playhouse  which  at least  is entertaining   it is full of ridiculous moments  not the least of which is alice krige s character  when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show  it is so absurd as to be sickening  all the people who had cameos in this  including john landis are lucky they still have careers  but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end  which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart  the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497949,i have watched 3 episodes of caveman  and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better   br    br   to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials  with no real humor  as we sat around watching these shows  we all speculated on what was going to happen  br    br   the episode of the woman cave woman with a attitude was actually a big  yea right  for us  she s crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers  and truth be told  she needed a slap br    br   i consider myself a pretty good reviewer  taking in everything  but i must say  cavemen is comparable to the old show  my mother  the car  i give it a 2  only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085358,excruciatingly slow paced  over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting  br    br   maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode  but by the last half  you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372873,why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour  divorced women with indifferent daughters  and why very little reference to the original show and characters  the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting  why can t there ever be daughters who like their mother s on tv  it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis  and rhoda would return to nyc  but why couldn t phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars  it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters  it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course  but it could have been better  much better  well  there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion  a dick van dyke show reunion  hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411031,when hey arnold  first came on the air in 1996  i watched it  it was one of my favorite shows  then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so i got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it  i was sort of surprised when i heard about hey arnold  the movie since it doesn t seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other nickelodeon cartoons like spongebob squarepants  nevertheless  having nothing better to do  i went to see the movie anyway  going into the theater  i wasn t expecting much  i was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens  cartoon like the recess movie was  i guess i got what i expected  it was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more  there were some good parts here and there  but for the most part  the movie was a stinker  simply for kids

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995752,in this forgettable trifle  the 40 ish norma shearer plays a fluttery  girlish socialite in monte carlo  caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor  it would be tempting to blame this movie s failure on the dull  talky script  or director george cukor  who never seems interested in livening up the film s generally comatose state  mostly  though  it s the fault of shearer herself  who desperately wanted to keep playing  young  parts as long as she could get away with it  inadvertently  this makes  her cardboard lover  a bizarre monument to an aging woman s vanity 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097981,this film came recommended as a good action film  which i don t really think it is  i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow  there really isn t that much action until the end of the film and it s pretty dark and hard to see what s really happening  i was sure hoping for something different  but  alas  didn t find it here 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272308,this movie is a modest effort by spike lee  he is capable of much more than this movie get on the bus while apparenly anti racist  does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo  the plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to louis farrakhan s million man march  the bus has every type of person you could imagine gay  muslim  gangbanger and the uncle tom he is thrown off the bus though   there was one only white person on the bus  he was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive  despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus i hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes  this should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment  you may think i am a racist for writing this but i mean well  better luck next time spike

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066115,ok  i think the tv show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved  so  when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie  i decided to tag along  i wish i d stayed home and watched the tv show instead  br    br   the fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie  the plot is next to non existant  the characters seem to exist in a vacuum  and  worst of all  gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever  it appears that disney took all of the things that make inspector gadget work on tv and tossed them all  to be fair  my younger child  8 years old  liked the movie but the older one  10 years old  came away thinking it silly  he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor   br    br   generally  i like disney films but this one misses by a mile  it is ok for a very narrow age band  say 7 to 9  but a must miss for everybody else 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377713,this is an  anthology  horror film  it s made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch  who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h p  lovecraft  but is most famous for the original story  psycho    the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn t think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all  it would have been better to do it as a comedy like  comedy of terrors   only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way  and it s probably the best of them  the one with ingrid pitt   i ve seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis   tales from the crypt   the anthology style works well for the producers  because it means that they can hire a bunch of  big name  actors  employ them for only one week of shooting or so  and then bring in the next big name  so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee  but that s very unfortunate for the audience  because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing  christopher lee  and ingrid pitt actually acting together  instead they re stuck in these vignettes by themselves  so let s take them one at a time  briefly  br    br   the first story has denholm elliot  who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character  unfortunately the actor who plays dominic  the source of the horror  tom adams  just looks silly which ruins any possible horror  there s some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though  like the scene where dominic kills elliot s psychiatrist  it s the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching  so the whole audience is supposed to shout out  look out behind you   the second story is the one with peter cushing  god i love that man so much  too bad so many of his films  like this one  pretty much stink  in the story he s supposed to be pining away for a long lost love  and he sees her likeness in a wax museum  it s a completely predictable story that goes nowhere  br    br   then you have the bit with christopher lee  where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch  again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs  but instead we re supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil  the actress  chloe franks  was pretty good in that type of  bad seed  role though  br    br   the last story is kind of amusing    ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire  that s about all the story has to offer  i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt s english is  i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i ve seen her in  br    br   not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists
