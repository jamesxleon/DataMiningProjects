# Proyecto 4 : Feature Selection
## Simulated Annealing (SA) + Symmetrical Uncertainty

### The work has been divided in sections to be considered as follows:

## 1. Data Preprocessing (James)

**Objective**

To normalize the dataset so that the features are scaled within a specific range.

**Steps to Implement**
- Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv().
- Apply Min-Max scaling to normalize the features.

**Need to know for the defense!**
- Understanding Min-Max scaling and its effect on the dataset.

## 2. _**Feature Selection Method: Simulated Annealing + Symmetrical Uncertainty**_ (Nico & Daniel, this will be a real challenge, so le the faith of the gods be with you)

**Objective**

To implement a feature selection algorithm using Simulated Annealing combined with Symmetrical Uncertainty as the objective function.

**Steps to Implement**
- Implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
- Define Symmetrical Uncertainty as the objective function.
- Use Simulated Annealing to select feature subsets based on Symmetrical Uncertainty.

**Need to know for the defense!**
- Understand the Simulated Annealing algorithm, its parameters, and how it works for optimization problems.
- Familiarize yourself with the Symmetrical Uncertainty metric and how it measures the relevance of features.

## 3. Top Five Feature Subsets (Nicky, on this depends the rest of the semester so beware)

**Objective**

To identify the top five feature subsets based on their per capita importance.

**Steps to Implement**

- Use the Simulated Annealing algorithm to generate a list of promising feature subsets.
- Calculate the per capita importance for each feature subset.

**Need to know for the defense!**
- Understand the concept of per capita importance and how to calculate it.

## 4. AUC Score-based Ranking (Sebas, this one should be pretty easy actually, so you owe us one)

**Objective**

To rank the top five feature subsets based on their AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores.

**Steps to Implement**
- Use a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, etc.) to evaluate the AUC score for each of the top five feature subsets.
- Rank the subsets based on their AUC scores.

**Need to know for the defense!**
- Understanding the AUC metric and how it is used to evaluate classification models.
- Familiarize yourself with ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves.

## 5. Interpretation and Conclusion (James)

**Objective**

To interpret the results and conclude the study.

**Steps to Implement**
- Discuss the per capita importance and its implications.
- Interpret the AUC scores for the feature subsets.
- Conclude the study, noting any limitations and suggesting avenues for future work.

**Need to know for the defense!**
- Methods for interpreting AUC scores and per capita importance.
- Limitations of using Simulated Annealing and Symmetrical Uncertainty for feature selection.
